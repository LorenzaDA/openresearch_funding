<title> A database of funding opportunities promoting open research practices </title>
</head>

<body>
<h1> Funding opportunities mentioning open research practices </h1>
 <h2> Aims of this work </h2>
<p> This work is part of a collaborative project on how senior academics can
  implement and support open research practices in 3 practical steps: 1) changing hiring criteria, 2) changing how scholarly outputs are credited, 3) changing how publishing and funding
  are addressed. We hope that this database can aid change in funding. By creating
  a resource where funds supporting open research practices are highlighted, we hope to increase awareness on how funding bodies are promoting a cultural change towards open research and to inspire researchers
to be part of such cultural change. More information is available in our <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jyfr7"> preprint</a>.
  The authors of this preprint are additionally supporting open research practices through the <a href="http://riotscience.co.uk/about-us/"> R.I.O.T. Science Club</a>,
  a grassroots initiative providing training in reproducible, interpretable, open, and transparent science.
</p>
<h2> Data collection and selection </h2>
<p> This database contains research funding opportunities which mentioned
  open research practices or principles.
  Data on any available research grant were automatically collected from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/"> National Institutes of Health </a>
  and the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/"> UK Research and Innovation </a> websites, based on the following
  <a href = https://github.com/LorenzaDA/openresearch_funding> openly available code</a>.
  Of note, such websites were selected as they allow for automatic collection of
  funding data, contrarily to other databases. However, there are a number of funding agencies supporting
  open research practices whose grants could not be included here and which we suggest consulting, e.g. <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/"> Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</a>.
After data collection, grants were filtered based on a series of keywords, such as FAIR principles and reproducibility (see <a href="https://github.com/LorenzaDA/openresearch_funding">scripts</a> for more details).
