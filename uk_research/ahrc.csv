"Summary
Through this new COVID-19 rapid response funding call, we invite proposals for research that can generate evidence to improve understanding of the effects of the pandemic on behaviours, systems and structures associated with modern slavery. This includes both the effects of the pandemic and the responses to it by governments, businesses and organisations, which can affect people’s vulnerability to exploitation, and the systems underpinning exploitative practices. The projects must be hosted by an eligible institution in the UK, but may look globally in their scope and impact.
Research proposals submitted can aim to address both the effects of and responses to the pandemic, and should have an appropriate balance between identifying problems and proposing actions to address or mitigate those problems.
The funding call will operate on a rolling basis in order to respond effectively to the evolving nature of the pandemic.

Scheme Opens:  Monday, 8 June 2020

Important Notice
Over the last 12 months, the AHRC has been consulting our community regarding the Leadership Fellows scheme, including the benefits, the challenges and what you would like to see changed to make it even better.
As a result of this we would like to draw your attention to a few updates we will be making to the scheme, namely:

We have clarified what we mean by ‘leadership’ to ensure it resonates with all academics at all stages of their career;
We have increased the maximum funding amount for the Standard Route to £300,000

To signal these changes, we have renamed the scheme the ‘AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowships’. The scheme guidance has also been tweaked, to ensure the aims and objectives of the scheme are clearer. The scheme continues to support two routes: Standard and Early Career.
Developing the fellow’s skillset and leadership capabilities are a core element of this scheme, for example by enabling early career researchers (ECRs) to become future research leaders in their field, or by enabling mid-career and established researchers to extend their expertise into new research areas or to engage with non-academic audiences.
The Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative and bold in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues of their discipline or beyond, for example, shaping research agendas, developing emerging research areas, fostering interdisciplinary research in their field, providing intellectual leadership, etc.

AHRC’s Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship Scheme is designed to support arts and humanities researchers at all career stages, enabling each Fellow to undertake ambitious, innovative research and to develop as researchers, thus enhancing their careers.
The scheme has two routes:

a standard route to support mid-career and established researchers
a dedicated route to support early career researchers (ECRs)

The aims of the Fellowship Scheme are to provide time and support for researchers:

to carry out high-quality individual research which has the potential to generate a significant impact on their discipline;
to develop capabilities as research specialists and to create opportunities for outreach beyond their research field;
to undertake innovative and collaborative development activities, including the initiation of new research, which will result in benefits for their own discipline(s) and beyond.

It should be noted that this scheme is intended to support an integrated package of research and career enhancement activities which cannot effectively be supported through the routine provision of sabbaticals or other forms of research leave commonly funded through QR.
Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship awards are supported as a partnership with Research Organisations. Applicants should discuss any potential application with their Research Organisation at an early stage, as strong evidence of institutional support for the proposed Fellow’s development is required as part of the application process.
Applications to the scheme will be welcomed for research in any subject area within the AHRC’s remit. Proposals may be for research at a range of stages of development, provided that substantial high-quality research outputs are planned to emerge directly from the Fellowship. A range of activities, including knowledge exchange, can be included in proposals and the scheme incorporates elements of the former Fellowships in the Creative and Performing Arts and Knowledge Transfer Fellowships schemes.
The scheme provides opportunities for mid-career and established researchers who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the Research Funding Guide. There is a separate route to support applications from early career researchers.
The standard route of the Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship scheme provides funding for periods of between 6 and 18 months. Proposals with a full economic cost of between £50,000 and £300,000 may be submitted.

"Summary
Scheme Opens:  Thursday, 21 May 2020
The AHRC are pleased to launch a new pilot call for Fellowships aimed at arts and humanities researchers whose work is both of outstanding quality and has a significant Equality, Diversity and Inclusion dimension.
The funding available is intended to enable researchers to engage a variety of relevant stakeholders with their research, to embed their work into policy and practice, and to work with relevant communities to realise the full potential benefits of their research.  The Fellowships will therefore be inherently impact-focussed and cannot be used to conduct substantial new research.  For the purpose of this pilot call the focus is on the UK context, whilst recognising the potential cross-cultural value of internationally collaborative and connected research.
Many arts and humanities researchers working on the culture, history, literature, languages, though (and so on) of specific areas, regions and countries would consider the process and practice of engagement with stakeholder communities as a vital component of their research.  It is precisely this group of researchers that these Fellowships are aimed at, as success will depend on the ability to engage different groups with their research, work effectively within established networks and create valuable new partnerships.  The Fellowship should also aim to strengthen the disciplines, communities and institutions it is embedded within, so there will be an expectation that award holders will build in development opportunities for junior colleagues, practitioners or partners who have potential to enhance the ED&I aspects of their work.
In line with the pilot nature of this call, we would be interested to receive feedback from researchers who believe they may meet the criteria for the award of a Fellowship but have been unable to apply due to eligibility requirements, or other barriers.
Applications will not be limited in scope by the nine protected characteristics recognised under the Equality Act 2010: ED&I issues significantly affect groups not covered by the act (for example only, the sick; those with lower socio-economic status; other people victimised or discriminated against not on the basis of protected characteristics). Applicants will be expected to evidence and justify how any non-protected characteristic groups are affected by the issue their research project focusses on, and how any interventions would have a positive impact within that group. It is recognised that not all research into ED&I must be framed by challenges or barriers, so researchers working on positive or celebratory cultures and histories are also encouraged. 
This fellowship is limited to researchers working within arts and humanities disciplines. Research into history, languages, culture, heritage and creativity, or any other field in the arts and humanities, may all provide vital and distinctive insights into a range of contemporary ED&I challenges, but analysis indicates that although these projects are thematically linked they can also be widely dispersed and lack effective mechanisms for sustained coordination with the communities they are working with. It is hoped that projects and researchers that fall into this category would benefit from the engagement opportunities that the fellowship would offer.
Funding will be provided for researchers who have a strong track record of integrating their research within communities, engaging stakeholders with their research and/or communicating with the public.  Therefore, in order to be eligible for this scheme, proposals need to outline how they plan to engage stakeholders such as:

Policymakers across the UK, including Westminster and Whitehall; Devolved Governments; Mayors and Local Government; and any relevant informal or community-based policy structures.
The general public; people living in recognised or informal communities, and organisations or groups affiliated with, or a part of, such communities
Institutions, including businesses (including but not limited to the creative industries); employers and service providers; cultural institutions (GLAM and heritage organisations etc.) and the media. 
New disciplinary networks that have been identified as having particular potential for collaboration in the topic area.

Applicants do not need to engage with all these groups but should ensure that all stakeholders relevant to their ED&I topic/s have been considered and that plans for engagement activities, tailored to the needs of the different stakeholders, are set out clearly in the application. 
Applicants should note that as this fellowship is impact and engagement-focused, funding for substantial new research is not permissible. The funding is therefore limited to events, seminars, workshops, policy engagement, communication and knowledge exchange. Synthesis of existing research may be in scope where the value and relevance to the proposed programme of engagement can be clearly demonstrated. The programme of engagement should be built around existing outputs that the applicant feels would have further impact potential though a period of sustained support. Applicants who view collaborative work as part of their research process are encouraged, where it can be demonstrated that further engagement with relevant individuals and communities is central to their exploration of the topic. This fellowship cannot be used for theoretical research on particular ED&I topics, groups or communities.  New research projects emerging from the fellowship should be directed to other (e.g. responsive mode) funding schemes. 
Proposals for funding should make clear not just which audiences they plan to engage and how they plan to do so, but how this interaction will benefit the communities they work with, their research and their discipline more widely. The planned programme of engagement  must evidence how it will advance discussions around their ED&I topic, contribute to the generation of new policy initiatives or ways of doing things and otherwise enrich and strengthen the project partners and communities involved.  
Applicants will need to demonstrate that they have robust existing relationships in place with the networks, platforms or partners necessary to deliver their programme of engagement. The fellowship will not provide substantial amounts of funding or time for the development of new partnerships, so it is important that the fellows clearly evidence the networks and relationships that they already have in place. For example, if an event series was dependent on the participation of an organisation such as the BBC, the UN, or specific community organisations, they would need to evidence the commitment of this partner to participate at the point of application.
The applicant’s host institution should use the fellowship as an opportunity to consolidate and solidify an ethical commitment to any community or interest groups they are partnering with as part of a wider organisational engagement strategy. The host institution will be required to set out how this commitment will stimulate additional and sustainable partnership activity and should be prepared to indicate how they will support ongoing relationships beyond the life of the fellowship. 
In order to help develop further capacity in their discipline, there is an expectation for applicants to include explicit commitments to mentoring or partnership working with researchers earlier on in their careers in order to facilitate sharing of  expertise and access to relevant networks. It is hoped that this will allow researchers, practitioners and community members to hone and develop their engagement skills and cultural competency, as well as helping them to develop relationships with groups and individuals relevant to their research.

"Summary
The Joint Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage and Global Change (JPICH) is pleased to announce a new funding opportunity. The Cultural Heritage, Identities & Perspectives: Responding to Changing Societies (CHIP) call invites scholars to submit research proposals on the role of heritage in society from different (inter)national perspectives and value systems. This includes questions such as what role does heritage play in the formation of identities, how can institutions manage heritage in an inclusive manner, and to what extent digitization contributes to meaningful access to heritage. The call aims to support interdisciplinary research that is set up and carried out by transnational consortia within the context of a single project.
Considering the circumstances, the anticipated deadline for the call will be 22nd September 2020.
The topics are:

rethinking the implicit role of cultural heritage in society;
perspectives on and constructions of cultural heritage;
cultural heritage management approaches: co-creation, connecting communities, and sustainable development goals;
innovative and inclusive (digital) access to cultural heritage;
impacts of cultural heritage: cultural, economic, user, public and social values.

Applicants are encouraged to collaborate in a cross-disciplinary manner in order to combine knowledge and expertise from the humanities and social sciences, arts, and the technical and/or physical sciences. Interdisciplinary exchange is necessary to develop innovative research into cultural heritage. Five topics have therefore been selected in the call. Applicants are expressly invited to combine questions from/perspectives on several topics.
Budget and participating countries
The total amount of 6,130,081 euros will be available for researchers based in researchers working in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Greece, the Kingdom of The Netherlands, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, who can jointly submit a proposal.

About JPI Cultural Heritage & Global Change
This call is part of a ‘roadmap for calls’ for the period 2017-2020. In the past, calls organised in the context of the JPICH concerned research into digital heritage (2017), heritage in changing environments (2018), and conservation, protection and use (2019). Three projects from the Conservation, Protection and Use call starting in Spring 2020 include UK researchers: CURBATHERI- Curating Sustainable URBAn Transformations through HERItage (Dr Kalliopi Fouseki, University College London, /Dr Chiara Bonacchi, University of Stirling), PHE- The Past Has Ears (Professor Damian Murphy, University of York) and IRIS- Inspiring rural heritage: sustainable practices to protect and conserve upland landscapes and memories (Professor Christopher Gerrard, University of Durham).
Since 2010, eighteen countries in various combinations have aligned their research programmes. Forty-nine research projects into cultural heritage have started of which twenty-six have now been completed. The completed projects are funded from the JPICH calls: First Pilot Call (2013) and Heritage Plus Joint Call (2014). UK researchers have been successful in the JPI CH transnational calls with participation in 27 out of the 49 transnational research projects to date.

The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), on behalf of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), working in partnership with the UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Multi Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF) is pleased to announce a new funding initiative for Innovation Awards / Case Studies on the impacts of COVID-19 on persons with disabilities under the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). This call aims to bring together UK and Low and Middle Income Country (LMIC) cross-disciplinary research expertise with UNDP and UNPRPD members country offices as relevant, governments, civil society (in particular those representing persons with disabilities) and persons with disabilities to co-produce a cluster of innovation awards / research case studies.
The aim of these awards / studies is to build the evidence base about the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on persons with disabilities, to explore the development of new participatory, co-produced and other mixed research methods and approaches drawing across disciplines for undertaking situational analysis in developing countries and to inform the development of strategies for disability inclusive recovery from the pandemic and ‘building back better’ to a more disability inclusive world.
Discussions with UNPRPD have identified that as the COVID-19 pandemic has become a global public health emergency, there is a need for collaborative research that can help LMIC countries develop national frameworks for disability inclusive recovery. This research need includes supporting innovative research approaches to enhance situational analysis, reflecting local cultural contexts and co-produced with persons with disabilities, on the status and experience of persons with disabilities and how they have been impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic and its wider societal impacts, for example, on sustainable livelihoods, delivery of services, human rights, cultures, and behaviours. This includes the repercussions of responses to the pandemic on persons with a wide range of disabilities, the intersections with gender, age and other inequalities and the strategies for supporting disability inclusive recovery within the medium to long term.
Applicants may apply for funding of up to £100,000 (fEC) over a period of up to 6 months in duration.  Eligibility and funding for this highlight notice is the same as for the AHRC GCRF Urgency Grants Pilot scheme and therefore proposals will only be accepted from LMIC country Principal Investigators from an organisation that leads or has previously led and held UKRI grants as the lead research organisation. All applications led by organisations outside of the UK must be able to provide a UKRI grant reference for a grant led and held by the organisation or they will not be eligible to apply as the lead research organisation under this highlight notice.
Proposals for innovation awards /case study research must focus on at least one LMIC/DAC List country amongst the 39 countries with which UNPRPD has established a joint national programme as detailed on the UNPRPD website, with the exception that we do not expect to fund projects focused primarily on China or India. We wish to fund innovation awards/research case studies addressing a range of different continents and LMIC contexts. Where appropriate, in addition to innovation awards /case studies focused on a single country,  awards/ studies could address regions within countries, cross-border areas or compare/ contrast several countries (this can include other LMIC countries as long as at least one of the countries of principal focus is a country with which UNPRPD has established a national programme).
In addition, we would particularly welcome proposals addressing any of the following three LMIC countries below with which UNPRPD has agreed inclusive country-specific COVID 19 response and recovery plans and situational analysis, to which the innovation awards /case study research funded through this highlight notice would enhance, complement and add value: 
1.Cambodia
2. Nepal
3. Zimbabwe
Projects funded under this highlight notice are expected to inform inclusive future planning at a national/regional level for recovery from the pandemic and to contribute to shared learning, experience and expertise across contexts to develop broader frameworks for building disability inclusive recovery and futures.
The AHRC is leading on this collaboration with UNPRPD MPTF on behalf of UKRI but this highlight notice is open to applications across all relevant disciplines and cross-disciplinary/ cross-Council proposals are welcomed.  
Full details on how to apply can be found in the highlight notice below which should be read in conjunction with the AHRC GCRF Urgency Grants pilot scheme call documents, particularly with regard to the eligibility requirements and guidance on costing outlines in that call documentation.

"Summary
The aim of this funding call is to support original, collaborative research that will improve the current support system for victims and survivors of modern slavery, in order to fulfil their individual needs in short-term and longer-term recovery.
Projects should take a partnership approach, involving those on the frontline, and putting the needs of victims and survivors at the heart of research to influence future policy development.  They should seek to fill gaps in the evidence base in areas such as the decision-making processes for identifying people affected by slavery and the impact it has on survivors, the recovery and reintegration needs of both adults and children identified as victims, and approaches to prevent re-trafficking.
Proposals may be up to full economic cost of £300K for a period of up to 12 months.

"Summary
Recognising the fast-moving nature of many of the challenges facing low or middle income countries (LMICs), the AHRC has launched this scheme to provide an accelerated funding outlet for urgent arts and humanities research priorities.
Funded as a part of the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), it is an open, responsive mechanism through which arts and humanities researchers (working with other disciplines where appropriate) can respond to unanticipated urgent research needs, including (but not limited to) disasters, humanitarian emergencies, rapid radical political or economic change, changes to conflicts, major displacements of populations etc., or unanticipated time-limited opportunities for research to contribute to international development policy or practice.
Please note: This call document has been updated (May 2020) with additional eligibility restrictions (applying with immediate effect) relating to the submission of Expressions of Interest addressing the COVID-19 outbreak and a renewed focus on delivering global development impact to the UK’s partnerships with China and India through the GCRF.
Eligible projects must be fully compliant with the requirements of Official Development Assistance (ODA), addressing a development need or challenge with the potential to support low or middle income countries meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, applications must demonstrate the case for urgency, explaining why there is a need for arts and humanities research to be conducted within specified time constraints that cannot be supported through other funding routes.
NB: The primary focus of this scheme is to provide an accelerated route for funding projects where there is a demonstrably time-limited window of opportunity to conduct research or deliver project impact/outputs. It is not intended to provide a funding route for projects that may address urgent GCRF related problems, but that could reasonably be expected to be funded through existing AHRC/UKRI funding schemes and calls.
Applications for full economic costs up to £150,000 for a period of up to 18 months may be submitted at any time during the period of the pilot scheme. Applicants interested in applying should first submit an expression of interest to the AHRC at the earliest opportunity following the emergence of the urgency need or context. If the expression of interest is considered to fall within the scope of the scheme, applicants will then be invited to submit a full application through Je-S for consideration through an accelerated peer review process.

"Summary
The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), on behalf of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), is pleased to announce the call for the Discovery Projects of Towards a National Collection: Opening UK Heritage to the World.
Towards a National Collection represents a major investment (£19 million in total)  in the UK’s world-leading cultural and heritage sector. Funded from UKRI’s Strategic Priorities Fund, Towards a National Collection addresses the lack of coordination between different online collections and catalogues, which constitutes a major barrier to research and public access.
Forging new and deeper partnerships between Independent Research Organisations (IROs) and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), and using the catalytic potential of new technology, the programme will begin to dissolve barriers between different collections, opening them up to new cross-disciplinary and cross-collection lines of research, and at the same time diversifying their visitor base and the ways in which the public access them.
The aim is to begin to realise the full, combined potential of the collections not only for research but for the heritage economy and the wider social good, and to take the first important steps towards creating a virtual ‘national collection’.
The Discovery Projects form the major part of this investment, and this call aims to fund up to five projects over a maximum of 36 months within a total funding envelope of up to £15 million. The indicative limit for each project is £3 million.
For the full call specification please see the Towards a National Collection call guidance (PDF, 337KB)

"Summary
The Research Grants Schemes are intended to support well-defined research projects enabling individual researchers to collaborate with, and bring benefits to, other individuals and organisations through the conduct of research. This scheme is not intended to support individual scholarship.
Please note that as a minimum all applications under the Research Grants scheme are required to include a principal investigator and at least one co-investigator jointly involved in the development of the research proposal, its leadership and management and leading to significant jointly authored research outputs.
The standard route provides grants for projects with a full economic cost (fEC) between £50,000 and £1,000,000 for the duration of up to a limit of 60 months.
AHRC Project Studentships
In order to better harmonise doctoral training support across the Research Councils, the AHRC now only supports project students in strategic areas. As a result the AHRC has closed the Project Studentships option within its open call Research Grants scheme and we now only support project-based studentships in strategic and priority areas where there is demonstrable need for capacity building.
Project studentships may be available through targeted calls where there is a case for developing capability in a specific area. In such circumstances, the funding call will require applicants to specify the training environment to be provided by the Research Organisation(s) and plans for providing appropriate specialist training and development for the students concerned. In addition, where this will enhance the provision, the AHRC will consider allowing these studentships to have ‘open eligibility’; that is, to permit applications from international students as well as UK and EU nationals.
Project studentships are no longer permitted on any research grant application except for strategic calls that specifically state that you may apply for capacity-building studentships alongside the grant.
The AHRC is committed to supporting excellent research training and this will also continue through our Block Grant and Collaborative Doctoral award competitions. Both the AHRC Delivery Plan and the AHRC Strategy 2013–18 make clear that postgraduate funding will remain the largest single scheme in our funding. This currently amounts to more than £40 million each year.

"Summary
In 2009 the UKRI Councils (which were then operating under RCUK), FAPESP, and the Research Council for the State of São Paulo, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to welcome, encourage and support proposals that may cut across our national boundaries and involve international collaborative teams. In recognition of the success of this partnership, the MoU was renewed in December 2015 for a further five years, until 31st December 2020.
The MoU provides for a 'Lead Agency Agreement' whereby the relevant UK Research Council will receive and assess collaborative proposals from eligible institutions on behalf of both organisations. FAPESP nominated experts will be involved with the peer review and decision making processes throughout. For further information see the UKRI/FAPESP Memorandum of Understanding.

"Summary
The Research Networking Scheme is intended to support forums for the discussion and exchange of ideas on a specified thematic area, issue or problem. The intention is to facilitate interactions between researchers and stakeholders through, for example, a short-term series of workshops, seminars, networking activities or other events. The aim of these activities is to stimulate new debate across boundaries, for example, disciplinary, conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and/or international. Proposals should explore new areas, be multi-institutional and can include creative or innovative approaches or entrepreneurship. Proposals must justify the approach taken and clearly explain the novelty or added value for bringing the network participants together.
Proposals for full economic costs up to £30,000 for a period of up to two years may be submitted. The exact mechanism for networking and the duration is up to the applicants to decide but must be fully justified in the proposal. An additional threshold of up to £15,000 full economic cost may be sought to cover the costs of any international participants or activities in addition to the £30,000 fEC scheme limit. Proposals will need to be submitted by an eligible Research Organisation but must involve collaboration with at least one other organisation, as well as having significant relevance to beneficiaries in the UK.

Highlight notices are intended to stimulate proposals under specified themes /strategic priorities in order to rapidly advance thinking or collaboration in these areas. Highlight notices are offered as opportunities within existing AHRC research schemes and are therefore assessed under the same criteria and assessment process.
Highlight notices are applied for a set period of time, for example 12 months, and the descriptions are usually intended to guide inquiry rather than prescribe individual research topics.
It is hoped, that successful proposals addressing highlight notices will help to build capacity in the specified area. For example, activities funded under a highlight notice for an AHRC theme could inform the future development of the theme by feeding back progress to the relevant subject team at the AHRC and representatives attending events related to the award or through coordinated activities organised by the AHRC.
Proposals relevant to the highlight notice can be submitted at any time while the highlight notice is in existence. All proposals will be assessed on their quality and individual merits according to standard scheme criteria. Although proposals addressing the highlight notice will not be given priority in the assessment or ranking of applications, supplementary funding may be made available to support additional highly rated applications addressing the highlight notices that may not have otherwise been funded under the existing scheme budgets. As a result, applications addressing highlight notices may have an increased chance of funding, but only if they fully meet the excellence criteria for the scheme and high international standards of scholarship, originality, quality and significance as judged through peer review.
If your proposal is funded under a highlight notice, you will be expected to produce a short report at the end of the award summarising the outcomes of the work undertaken and the potential for the future development of the topic of the highlight notice. For example by highlighting potential innovative new multi-disciplinary research, partnership, international links, researcher development, or knowledge exchange opportunities.

"Summary
The AHRC Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement Scheme (FoF) provides funds to support innovative and creative engagements with new audiences and user communities which stimulate pathways to impact. Funds will be awarded for knowledge exchange, public engagement, active dissemination and commercialisation activities that arise unforeseeably during the lifespan of or following an AHRC-funded project. The scheme does not support supplementary funding for continuation of research activities.
Proposals must clearly demonstrate both a well-defined non-academic need for the work and engagement with potential users and stakeholders in developing their project. Proposed activities must enhance the value and wider benefit of the original research project and clearly demonstrate how they will deliver significant economic, social, cultural and/or policy impacts.
The scheme aims to encourage and facilitate a range of interactions and creative engagements between arts and humanities research and a variety of user communities including business and commercial, third sector and heritage sector, public policy, voluntary and community groups and the general public.
The AHRC Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement scheme operates without formal deadlines and will offer awards of up to £100,000 (fEC) for a maximum of 12 months. Smaller awards of up to £30,000 (fEC) are encouraged for shorter or higher risk activities, for example testing the feasibility of an idea, exploring new partnerships for knowledge exchange, testing the market or investigating a new business model. Decision making times are reduced for these smaller awards.
