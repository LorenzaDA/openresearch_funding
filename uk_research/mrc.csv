We encourage applicants to check back regularly as we intend to provide ongoing updates here. Alternatively, if you would like to be contacted directly regarding the update of these call details, please email spfpain@mrc.ukri.org
The Medical Research Council, Versus Arthritis and other Partners announce the Director appointment for the Advanced Pain Discovery Platform (APDP). Please follow the link to the MRC news item.
APDP’s partner, Versus Arthritis, recently released a blog which focusses on the APDP programme and its Director, Professor David Walsh. Please visit the Versus Arthritis website to read the interview.

The Medical Research Council (MRC),  Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and Versus Arthritis are pleased to announce a £14m call for large and ambitious multidisciplinary consortia. This will build the foundation of a national-scale programme supporting discovery and translational science that will bring together leadership, tools and resources to help unravel the complexity of pain, driving new treatment development. This investment is part of a major new £24m initiative to establish an Advanced Pain Discovery Platform that is jointly supported by the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund and Versus Arthritis and will lead to step changes in the understanding and treatment of chronic pain across a wide range of conditions.
The call will make £14m available through 4-year awards to fund high impact, multidisciplinary consortia that between them will bring together researchers across the breadth of biomedical, social and data sciences. The consortia are expected to establish enduring national-scale leadership, infrastructure and capability that extends beyond the initial 4-year award. They will serve to underpin a future broader portfolio of pain research supported by UKRI, Versus Arthritis and others, and should collaborate with each other to ensure added value from the Advanced Pain Discovery Platform. The consortia are expected to embrace complementary access to patients and healthy volunteers and underpinning technology. Areas of focus could include multi-omic biology, image data generation, biological, cognitive and psychosocial factor identification, exploiting existing biological samples and data as well as new sample/data collections. We expect to support 3-5 multidisciplinary consortia through this call.
Call information
The call will provide funding for collaborative multidisciplinary consortia that will focus on:

Pursuing innovative and ambitious “big ideas” in chronic pain research, which will enable a step change in the field.
Improving our understanding of the mechanisms of pain, building on our knowledge of normal pain processes to better understand chronic pain, taking into account biological, cognitive and psychosocial factors.
Collating, generating and interrogating human data and samples, to allow for the identification and validation of new interventions, and to allow improved access to well-phenotyped human populations.

Each application should demonstrate how it will:

Actively strengthen intersections between important disciplines that do not routinely engage with each other,
Build capacity in the field and develop skills.
Embed knowledge mobilisation.
Involve patient insight in the development of the outlined work as well as collaborate with them in the delivery of the proposed research.

It is expected that successful consortia will focus on chronic pain, offering important insights across chronic pain conditions. Applications may be focussed on specific pain-related disorders, or may consider common mechanisms underlying multiple pain conditions.
This initial call includes, but is not limited to, key staff posts and infrastructure costs, data collection and access, sample storage and sample analysis, with an emphasis on data and samples for patients and healthy volunteers. As these consortia will be co-funded between UKRI and Versus Arthritis, awards will be made at 67%.
As part of this APDP initiative, a second phase of complementary calls will be launched in the near future for hypothesis-led research projects (with the foci of these being either generated from within, or aligned to the successful consortia), a data management platform, and bioinformatics projects.
Process
The call process will be in two stages:

Expression of Interest
To participate in this call for consortia, you must submit an Expression of Interest to UKRI via a bespoke online submission system by 31st of August 2020. The online submission system can be accessed here, there is an option to save your draft submission as you go. A pro-forma, which allows you to complete the Expression of Interest questions offline, can be found here. You must complete all sections of the form for your Expression of Interest to be eligible. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the preparation of expressions of interest is recognised by the funders, and it is anticipated that details of workstreams and consortium partners might evolve between selection and submissions of full application.
 
Full application
Shortlisted Expressions of Interest applications will be invited to submit a full application via Je-S by January 2021. Guidance on how to make the full submission will be provided to successful Expression of Interest applicants. Applicants will be invited to be interviewed by a bespoke panel of experts as part of the funding decision.

Expressions of Interest
The purpose of the Expression of Interest phase is to enable the selection of the highest quality applications, and those that are likely to develop into competitive full proposals. Assessment of Expressions of Interests will based on the following:
Scientific potential and tractability:

Is there a clear “big idea” in chronic pain research that is being considered, that sets this aside from standard project and programme grants?
What are the key hypotheses underpinning this “big idea”?
Are the data to be collected through the consortium necessary and sufficient to answer the questions being proposed?
Is there a compelling rationale for large-scale investment in this area?
Does the proposed consortium clearly describe the vision and science underpinning it?
Where relevant, is there potential for the research to stimulate future industry Research and Development or provide other value to industry?
Is it sufficiently ambitious whilst being realistic in terms of content and deliverables?

Quality of the consortium:

Does it seek to establish a dynamic research platform able to respond to internal and external scientific developments?
Does it present a set of work packages and governance structure that synergise across consortia, able to provide a balanced portfolio of short and longer term outputs, which can provide a range of partnering opportunities?
Does the consortium have an appropriate strategy to address the data management, data analysis and methodological challenges that it is likely to face?
Is there evidence of strong interdisciplinary partnerships within academic and clinical teams, (taking into account the biological, cognitive and psychosocial factors underpinning pain) and strong links with infrastructure, patients and industrial partners, or evidence of plans to build these networks in preparation for a full submission?
Is there a clear commitment for Patient and Public Involvement in the development of the application and to be embedded within the Consortium; and
In light of all of the above, is there a strong case for large scale investment in this consortium?

Where multiple consortia are submitting Expressions of Interest that are in similar areas of research, or where there is significant overlap, UKRI and Versus Arthritis, under guidance of its expert peer review panels, may ask that consortia work together at the full application stage. By submitting an Expression of Interest to this call, you are agreeing to UKRI/Versus Arthritis potentially sharing the Lead Investigator (Section 2.1), Title (Section 1.1), and Summary (section 1.2) from your Expression of Interest, with other applicants.

Innovation Hubs for Gene Therapies

Time remaining:

Status: Open
Open date: 4 May 2020
Closing date:
3 Sep 2020 16:00 GMT+1
Type: Grants, Researcher-led
Categories: Translation

 
Background
The UK has an outstanding academic base in the field of gene therapies which has expanded rapidly over the past decade. However, translation of UK initiated gene therapies into clinical and financial value has been inhibited by a lack of facilities to support the development of these therapies through early stage clinical trials.  Researchers report a lack of access to and/or long wait times for GMP vector manufacture causing significant delays. UK researchers are forced to source viral vectors from overseas.  This adds to the complexity, increasing the challenges of technology transfer and slowing the process of translation. With this we also lose both the knowledge and the skills needed to sustain and grow this sector. Targeted investment by LifeArc, the MRC and potentially other funders will:

Accelerate the translation of new therapies including those for rare disease patients in desperate need of new treatment options,
Increase UK capacity for GMP viral vector manufacturing to support academically led translation by expanding or repurposing existing facilities and enabling new facilities
Expand the UK skills base in gene therapy development, technology transfer, medicines translation and GMP grade vector manufacturing,
Establish a coordinated national network linking the facilities,
Enable improved coordination of vector manufacturing process development, ensuring access to advanced manufacturing methods and shared IP for the UK academic network which also aligns to support rapid transition to commercial scale.   

A minimum of £16m will be jointly committed through this call by LifeArc and the MRC. This call may also benefit from support from other funders, such as the BBSRC, potentially increasing the total budget. The ambition of this call is to create a diverse, coordinated network of complementary facilities and it is expected that funding requests may vary in size. An optimal investment would include a complementary suite of activity across the UK, ranging from smaller awards to for example repurpose existing clean room facilities or import additional platforms to existing facilities (e.g. £1-2M), to larger scale investment in new or expanded infrastructure (£5-6M) for innovative gene therapy product development.
Opportunity
The UK has a compelling track record of academic gene therapies leading into commercialisation and high value spin-outs and licensing deals.  Academic facing GMP vector suppliers in the UK are limited. Demand consistently outstrips supply with many academic researchers seeking GMP vector overseas.
A number of UK groups have developed plans to build, extend or repurpose GMP suites for viral vector manufacture – however, all these plans are limited by a lack of available funding. While there is increasing commercial interest in this sector, it is apparent that their inevitable focus is on later-stage commercial projects and so academic demand will not be met.
There is therefore an opportunity for the creation of a network of translational Hubs to provide critical support that academics require to progress their gene therapy development projects to the point they make attractive commercial investments (potentially for LifeArc or other investors’ Seed or Venture Funds). This will include GMP grade viral vector manufacture for academic-led early phase clinical trials for genetic medicines.
Aims of the Innovation Hubs
The call aims to establish a networked suite of Hubs, providing expertise, GMP grade viral vector and regulatory support for academically led clinical trials of Gene Therapies. These Hubs will enable knowledge transfer of commercially scalable products from academic labs into GMP manufacturing via direct provision of appropriate manufacturing platforms, facilitated delivery of regulatory toxicology studies (through partners) and expert support for onward development into early phase clinical trials. The Hubs will support academic researchers throughout translation of their projects from the academic lab into patient trials. LifeArc and the MRC are committed to supplementing existing expertise within applicants’ institutions across the UK, filling gaps in capability and knowledge to accelerate treatments to patients. Once established, the hubs will actively reach out to potential applicants at the earliest stages of product development, ensuring the UK research community has sight and access to the facilities, skills and expertise available.
There are currently no AAV manufacturing facilities in the UK focused on supporting academic needs despite clear demand; addressing this will be a priority for the call. Proposals focussing on Lentivirus, a combination of AAV and Lentivirus production or other gene therapy technology would also be welcomed.
The Innovation Hubs will support skilled staff to coordinate innovative manufacturing research, drive generation of reproducible and shareable platforms and to enable dissemination of know-how and skilled personnel across a network of centres.
Shared commercially ready platforms, using common cell-lines, plasmids and reagents, would reduce costs, facilitate simplified licensing agreements and streamline regulatory reviews and streamline transfer to commercial scale. It is critical that such platforms are designed to facilitate the transition between small scale ‘academic’ supply for phase I/II trials through to larger scale supply by CDMOs or other commercial organisations for later phase trials and beyond.  The Innovation Hubs will be networked together with, for example, the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, CPI and Industry, to provide synergies and co-ordination across the facilitates allowing rapid dissemination of shared processes, IP and best practice guidance. 
A key output of the network will be to train and retain expert staff and creating a talent pool to fill the new high-value jobs which will be created (and required by SMEs and industry). As such links with the existing Advanced Therapies Apprenticeship Community and other skills solutions such as Masters courses in Advanced Therapies will be encouraged.
In addition to funding, successful applications will also receive access to LifeArc’s translational advice service.
Eligible activities that could be funded from this call include:

Staffing costs for dedicated posts – providing appropriate recognition and enabling talent retention
Staff training
Facility and maintenance costs for necessary laboratory space
Equipment and reagents to underpin viral vector manufacturing projects
Network management and dissemination costs
Purchasing of network shared licences for process know-how or vector backbones.
GMP certification and refurbishment costs that would enable existing clean rooms without current GMP status to obtain this
Support services to enable the Hubs to operate in an efficient and agile way for example to contracts services.

It is expected that applications will include several of these activities and an application for only one activity is unlikely to be competitive. In addition to the core translational role of the Hubs, this funding could enable co-ordinated fundamental innovation in manufacturing processes and analysis across a small number of Hubs as below:

Development and validation of analytic standards to underpin QC of clinical development programmes
Process development and innovation programmes to improve manufacturing productivity and quality. Research into the in vivo efficacy of viral vectors will be considered out of scope, but appropriate work could include:

Optimisation of existing manufacturing platforms to deliver efficiency gains
Adaptation of platforms to provide seamless transition from small to larger batch manufacture e.g. from adherent to non-adherent cell lines or incorporation of closed manufacturing systems.
Development and validation of new manufacturing platforms across upstream and downstream processes, e.g. development of new stable producer cell lines
Development and validation of standardised analytical assays for product characterisation



Assessment of proposals will be on a portfolio basis, with the aim of ensuring that the final investment offers a diverse suite of capability to maximise UK translational activity in this space.
Eligibility, Scope and Governance
Proposed hubs must be based within UK-based research organisations or businesses and all awards must comply with UK subsidy control and/or EU State Aid regulations as applicable. Proposals for large infrastructure beyond the current funding envelope are outside the scope of this competition.
Maintaining freedom to operate for users of these Hubs is critical and proposals seeking to secure rights to or revenue shares in developed products will not be eligible for support. Importation of manufacturing platforms from commercial entities is eligible for inclusion in the Hubs, provided that this does not lead to encumbrance of researchers. Indeed, manufacturing platforms that align with downstream commercial platforms will create efficiencies in onward translation and are therefore encouraged. However, proposed solutions that include reach-through from commercial partners into supported products or carry IP restrictions which would restrict commercialisation of arising products would be outside the remit of this funding scheme – it is critical that the Hub network is positioned to enable independent academic development and exploitation.  
Commercial manufacturing capability is not eligible for support through this scheme, although funding to expand or extend a facility with dedicated capability for academically-led projects, in parallel with commercial capacity funded elsewhere, will be acceptable. These facilities would be expected to upscale capacity for academically-led projects proportionately to any funding received through this call.
Project selection for the Hubs will not be devolved to individual awardees but will instead be performed by a network governance structure which will include representation from MRC and LifeArc. This oversight group will consider the different capabilities of the Hubs as well as available capacity, ensuring that the network remains focussed on capacity for academic-led projects. Academically led projects supported by the Hub funders will be prioritised where this is necessary and it is expected that Hubs may operate a mixed model where any excess capacity is available for commercial manufacture, although this scenario is considered unlikely.
Competitive applications are expected to:

Provide a clear link to an excellent academic research base with experience of gene therapy development
Illustrate clear links with downstream manufacturing provision, regulatory support and commercial advice for users [1]
Demonstrate appropriate manufacturing expertise and innovation support, coupled with GMP capability and expertise suitable to enable rapid innovative product development arising from UK academia
Have clear engagement with clinical sites for onward delivery of clinical trials
Show they can be operational quickly; it is therefore expected that locations where facilities can be repurposed or expanded will be more competitive
Be able to operate efficiently. It may be appropriate for Hubs to set up with their own administrative or legal structures within a host organisation to allow the Hubs to be agile and to appropriately incentivise staff where this is not already in place
Demonstrate governance structures with a clear strategic balance between patient need and sustainability
Include a credible plan for obtaining sustainability within a 5-year period
Include milestones for progression over the funding period

Assessment Criteria
Assessment will aim to ensure that the key aims for this initiative are delivered across the funded portfolio. Applications will be assessed against the following criteria:

Vision for the hub. Has the bid assessed the current vector manufacturing landscape and the outputs of the academic gene therapy community? Does the bid clearly articulate how it will impact on academic facing viral vector manufacturing? Does the bid clearly set out how academic-facing capacity will be ring-fenced and balanced with other competing requests? Does the bid convincingly demonstrate how the proposed solution addresses the needs of the academic gene therapy community?
Track record. What experience does the proposed Hub leadership have of managing large strategic investments? What experience does the proposed Hub have in viral vector manufacturing or delivery of novel gene therapy trials? 
The environment. Is the environment for the proposed Hub appropriate for this investment? What are the proposed mechanisms to link to the academic Gene Therapy community and clinical infrastructure? How will the proposed Hub create an environment and resource that supports the flow of translation through initial academic-led early phase trials through to later phase trials? How will the Hub create an environment where academics can receive support in lab-based vector manufacture that aligns with GMP manufacture processes for onward translation?
Growth of the UK skills base. Does the bid clearly articulate how it will use this funding to support skills development in ATMP manufacturing? How will the proposed Hub link with existing and upcoming skills bolstering schemes both nationally and internationally? How will the Hub reach-out to other Hubs to disseminate skills and knowledge in ATMP manufacturing?
Partnership supporting the proposed centre. Does the proposed Hub intend to leverage additional funding? How does the proposed Hub link to, and gain support from, existing infrastructure? How does the proposed Hub intend to maintain financial sustainability? What evidence is presented of links to downstream organisations to enable scaling beyond the translational scale of manufacturing?
Governance. How will the proposed Hub interact with the other successful centres and relevant infrastructure? Have all appropriate risks been identified alongside mitigation plans? Does the application include clear milestones/deliverables to demonstrate progress? Are all costs well justified? Will the Hub, in partnership with LifeArc staff, ensure the research and innovation activities are linked with regulators and policy makers?
The additionality of funding and value for money. What would happen if the proposed Hub was not funded? What would be the key outputs of this funding if awarded and how would this differ compared with commercial funding? How does the proposed solution represent value for money for the funders?

Assessment process
Applications to this call will be assessed and funding recommendations ultimately made by a bespoke panel of UK and international gene therapy experts nominated by LifeArc and the MRC, drawn from a range of academic and commercial backgrounds. All material assessed by the Panel as part of this call will be held in strict confidence and panel members will be recused from any discussion where they, or their affiliated interests, have a direct interest.
All timelines are subject to change, given the rapidly evolving situation around COVID-19, but the overall assessment process will cover the following stages:

Expressions of interest assessed by a Steering Group including representation from the Panel (and office staff from MRC and LifeArc). This would likely be non-gated but would provide the opportunity for feedback to applicants with potential for combining separate bids where they are closely aligned. EOI deadline – 1 June 2020.
A compulsory virtual workshop hosted by LifeArc and the MRC where all applicants will have the opportunity to ask questions and receive feedback on the expressions of interest – 23 June 2020.
Submission of full application –3rd September 2020
Full Panel assessment – Nov 2020

Status: Open
Open date: 16 Jun 2020
Closing date:
8 Sep 2020 16:00 GMT+1
Type: Grants, Researcher-led
Categories: Global health

Please note change to previous calls - the African Research Leader candidate should now apply as the Principal Investigator (PI) on the grant and the UK-based mentor should be included as the first named Co-Investigator (Co-I). If successful, the award will be made to and administered by the African Research Organisation.
The UK Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development announce a further call for proposals for the prestigious African Research Leader awards.
This MRC/ DFID jointly funded scheme aims to strengthen research leadership across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by attracting and retaining exceptionally talented individuals who will lead high quality programmes of research on key global health issues pertinent to SSA. The African Research Leader (ARL; PI) should be supported by an enthusiastic local research environment and by a strong linkage with a UK partner (i.e. the UK Co-Investigator; Co-I).

Introduction
Lack of grant funding and research infrastructure in many sub-Saharan African countries can make it difficult to attract and retain talented African scientists and as a result, African nationals are currently under-represented as leaders in medical research in the region. The ARL scheme invites applications from African researchers already based in sub-Saharan African countries and from those individuals currently working overseas who wish to return to SSA. We would particularly welcome high-quality applications from female scientists and from investigators across a broad range of disciplines.
The scheme is open to talented and enthusiastic African investigators working in all biomedical and health research areas within the MRC/DFID remit on global health. A series of short case studies demonstrates the range of challenges being tackled by current ARL award holders (note, these awards were made when the UK mentor was the named PI). It is important that applications address the key health problems relevant to national and regional health needs.
The African Research Leader will be supported by a UK based mentor as part of the partnership between their African and UK institutions.
Awards provide support for up to five years. The grant package includes a potential contribution to the African Research Leader’s salary (up to 100% in the first years); funds for a programme of research; funds for development activities and for collaborative activities between the African and UK institutions.  
Key elements of the Scheme
Strong applications will meet the four key elements of the scheme, namely:

a talented ‘rising star’ African Research Leader candidate, 
a high-quality research programme proposal, 
a research-conducive academic African environment / institution, 
a firm partnership with a UK partner institution 

Each should be described in the case for support which will be attached to the online application as indicated in the ‘How to apply’ section. Please refer to the detailed Case for Support guidance on how to structure this document. Further details on each of these elements are provided below, please read each section carefully.
The African Research Leader Candidate – a rising star
The ARL scheme seeks to support African researchers already based in sub-Saharan African countries and those individuals currently working overseas who wish to return to SSA.
The focus of the scheme is on ‘rising star’ African Research Leaders. Candidates will be high-calibre, early-to-mid career researchers, who show clear ability to cultivate a dynamic and innovative research group, likely to attract increasing international recognition and external funding by the end of the award.
The African candidate will have completed a PhD, will be well-qualified for academic research having spent at least the last 3 years in active research, be building a track record of independence in their selected field and demonstrating promise as a future research leader. Outstanding ARL candidates who do not have a PhD but who are educated to Master's level and have substantial research experience, as evidenced by their publication record, may also be considered in exceptional circumstances.
Applications from women are particularly encouraged. Candidates wishing to combine their research with domestic responsibilities may seek the award on a part-time basis. The terms and conditions of award make allowances for maternity/paternity leave. Allowance will also be made to those researchers whose career has been affected, either by a late start or by interruption, for personal or family reasons.
As a ‘rising star’ the African candidate will hold an established academic position in an African research institution, be developing a research team and be undertaking original research. This may be evidenced through a growing track record of staff and student supervision; through an expanding portfolio of lead author publications, by securing local or national funding and by attracting recognition through prizes and awards.
Researchers who already have a well-established record of securing significant international research grant funding or have reached a level of seniority e.g. professor or head of department should not apply to this scheme. These individuals may apply at any time as a co-investigator together with a UK-based principal investigator to any of our response mode funding schemes, and as principal investigator to the MRC Applied Global Health Research Board, depending on the focus of his/her research.
If a candidate is returning to work in SSA they are expected to make their own arrangements for obtaining a tenured academic position in an eligible African research institution if one is not already held (and should be in post by the start of any award). The successful ARL candidate would be expected to continue their appointment at the African research institution beyond the term of the ARL award. There are no UK residence eligibility restrictions for this scheme as the ARL candidate will be based in sub-Saharan Africa.
In addition to supporting scientific collaboration with the partner UK institution the scheme offers the African research leader an opportunity to spend time (up to 3 months) for further career development activities, training or skills development (eg research management/ mentoring/ publication writing/ industry internship etc) in either country.
 MRC/DFID aim to foster research leadership in a breadth of academic environments; it is therefore unlikely that several awards will be made to any one institution in a single call.
Proposed research programme 
The scheme is open to talented and enthusiastic investigators working in all health and biomedical research areas. Priority will be given to applications that address key health problems relevant to national and regional health needs in sub-Saharan Africa.
We welcome high quality applications from investigators across a broad range of research activities within the MRC/DFID global health remits, please refer to MRC’s and DFID’s strategic priority pages.
Activities can be focussed on any major health priority in Sub-Saharan Africa including:

Research focused on the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, cancer, respiratory disease, and mental health.
Prevention and control of infectious diseases (major diseases such as malaria, HIV and TB), neglected tropical diseases (including snakebite), zoonotic and emerging diseases, co-infections and issues associated with emerging resistance to current drugs.
Multimorbidity, i.e., the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions, including long-term infectious and non-communicable diseases and mental health conditions.
Basic, discovery health research approaches, experimental medicine providing mechanistic insight to human diseases, epidemiological (social, genetic, immunological) research, prevention research;
Applied research approaches, including public health, health systems, health policy, and implementation research;
Research targeting vulnerable or disadvantaged groups including refugees, people living in informal settlements, those living with disability, neonates, children, adolescents or the elderly.

The ARL scheme will not support clinical or health related trials including phase I safety, proof of principle, efficacy or effectiveness trials of any new medicinal product, device, vaccine or other clinical intervention. There are specific strategic streams of funding available for such research proposals. However, it will support observational programmes of epidemiological, laboratory, field and clinical research and early stage developmental or formative research which may be associated with or lead to future health intervention evaluation. If this is the case, the outcomes of the research and how these will be anticipated to inform future work should be made clear.
In recognition of the current COVID-19 pandemic, proposals contributing to the understanding, prevention and/or management of the COVID-19 outbreak are welcomed. We do not expect to only receive proposals in COVID-19 related research, however we do require an honest assessment of how the pandemic might affect your research plans. Please note, COVID-19 related proposals will be assessed according to the scheme specific assessment criteria in a competitive manner with wider non-COVID-19 research proposals.
The majority of the proposed research is expected to take place in the African environment. The African Research Leader (PI) should be supported by a robust research environment in their own local institution and by a strong linkage with a UK partner (Co-I). The resources requested should be specific, justified, and relevant to the research proposed.
This scheme is not primarily intended to support PhD students in obtaining their degree. PhD overseas fees, allowances and stipends will not be supported. However, if the ARL candidate does propose to involve PhD students to deliver elements of the work within their research programme, it will be necessary to explain how the supervision and input of those students will be managed to ensure their training is protected.  
The African Research Institution
The scheme is offered to candidates employed by eligible institutions based in sub-Saharan Africa, with sufficient research capacity to manage and deliver research. This can include:

Higher education institutions based in sub-Saharan Africa: A university or institution based in an LMIC with degree awarding powers recognised by the government in which the organisation is based. This includes MRC Units at LSHTM in Uganda and the Gambia.
Research institutes based in sub-Saharan Africa: A research focused institution based in an LMIC funded by the government of the country in which the organisation is based or by a not-for-profit non-governmental organisation.

If your Research Organisation has not previously received funding from the MRC, or you are unsure of the eligibility of your organisation please contact the office.
The PI’s host African Institution must offer a clear research and career development environment with appropriate laboratory, field or clinical facilities to enable the research activities proposed as well as supportive administrative functions. The candidate should be able to draw on mentoring from senior individuals, and their career development be nurtured. Where appropriate, fostering of scientific links across sub-Saharan African institutions is encouraged.
The African Institution will be expected to provide a strong commitment to the continuity of appointment of the researcher beyond the term of the award, such as a tenured position or equivalent. There is also an expectation that over time, the African Institution would increase its level of financial support of the individual (if not 100% from the outset).
The African Institution may build into the application a funding contribution for institutional development to support a set of institutional strategic objectives, the outputs of which should be verifiable and be able to be monitored. This could include capacity strengthening such as improved finance, data or research management, and professional training. Tools and good practice documents on capacity strengthening in low and middle-income countries are available on the TDR/ESSENCE website.
Partnership between the African and UK Institutions 
This scheme aims to encourage a research-supportive environment for the developing African Research Leader, both in the host African institution but importantly involving strong support from and access to expertise in a UK academic research institution.
The African Research Leadership proposal should therefore be submitted in partnership with a UK Co-Investigator offering relevant opportunities, such as senior or complementary scientific expertise, skill strengthening, discipline widening, technology sharing, mentoring, etc. The UK partner institution may be any eligible UK research institution, including MRC Institutes and University Units based in the UK.
The individual scientific partnership between the ARL candidate and the UK mentor must be underpinned EITHER by an established track record of partnership at the institutional level OR a clear plan for developing and sustaining long-term cross-institutional collaboration. Previous partnering need not be in exactly the same area of research proposed in the application however the relevant strengths that each institution brings to the research proposed should be indicated.
There is no restriction on the number of applications submitted by each institution however it is highly unlikely that we will make several awards to any one organisation.
Funding available
Funding for the scheme is provided by the UK MRC and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). Awards will provide support for up to 5 years and the MRC Contribution should not exceed £750k in total.
The majority of the funding will be for work taking place in the African research institution and so would be eligible for full economic costing (FEC) at 100% and must be entered as exceptions. Any costs specifically for the UK research institution will be provided on the basis of 80% FEC as usual. Please refer to the MRC Guidance for Applicants.
The total award package is anticipated to include the following elements:
1. The African Research Leader (PI) will be expected to commit a significant proportion of their time (50-100%), over the entire duration of the ARL award, to delivering the research programme. The African research institution will be the employer of the African Research Leader. A contribution to the personal salary for the ARL may be requested. This may be up to 100% in the first years where a persuasive case is made. The expectation is that over time, the African research institution will demonstrate their commitment to the ARL by taking increasing responsibility for providing the salary. In the final year of award this should be at least 50% of the personal salary.
2. Resources to undertake the proposed research programme, which could include research support staff, research consumables and equipment, travel costs (between partner institutions), and other necessary costs. MRC will support indirect and estates costs for organisations based in LMICs. Each LMIC RO can request indirect costs up to the value of 20% of their direct costs. Overseas student fees and stipends for PhD students contributing to the research will not be provided.
3. The award has provision for a personal development element for the ARL candidate, to support leadership development, strategic planning, research management and continuing professional development or other similar activities. As part of this, support may be requested for the opportunity to spend time (up to 3 months in total) in an organisation other than the host African research institution. This may be at the UK partner institution, or any other organisation including a biomedical/pharmaceutical company where skills and knowledge may be strengthened. This element is to provide a concentrated period of training/career development that cannot be achieved effectively within the African research institution. This would be in addition to collaborative scientific visits to the UK. Justification for the placement should be robust and details should be submitted on the placement template.  andidates should be prepared at interview to discuss in detail any career development visit proposed.
4. Additionally, an institutional development element is available for the African research institution to support a set of institutional objectives the outputs of which should be verifiable and be able to be monitored. Support can be requested for help to strengthen institutional capacity to host and sustain competitive research groups. This could include for example improved finance management, data or research management and other professional training. Tools and good practice documents on capacity strengthening in low and middle-income countries are available on the TDR/ESSENCE website.
A salary contribution for the UK mentor may be requested although we would expect this to be kept to a minimum. Other named SSA-based investigators are permitted on the application where they bring expertise from another discipline required to fully address the health challenge identified.
Tenure of award
The ARL award is intended to provide longer term support and will normally run for 4-5 years with a maximum tenure of five years. Candidates wishing to combine their research with domestic responsibilities may seek the award on a part-time basis over a maximum of five years. The terms and conditions of award include provision for maternity/paternity leave.
How to apply 
Please note change to previous calls - the African Research Leader candidate should now apply as the Principal Investigator (PI) on the grant and the UK-based mentor should be included as the first named Co-Investigator (Co-I).
Unlike previous ARL rounds and the majority of MRC’s funding routes, the ARL award will be made directly to the PI (i.e. the ARL) based within the African Research Institution. Please see ‘The African Research Institution’ section, above, for eligibility criteria.
Full applications should be submitted using the Research Councils’ Joint electronic Submission (Je-S) System. Access J-eS guidance.
Applicants are reminded of their responsibility to engage with their Research Office and discuss the time period required by the host RO to complete all the necessary application checks before completing the final electronic submission (through Je-S), to MRC. MRC have noted that on rare occasions, some applicants have not allowed their RO adequate time to complete all the required checks and electronic processes to enable the successful submission of applications prior to the deadline. It should also be noted that MRC will not consider permitting the submission of any late applications, where the applicant has failed to allow their Research Office adequate time to complete the required checks and complete the final Je-S submission to MRC before the advertised call closes.
Je-S Registration:
All investigators and their institutions will need to be registered on the Je-S system. This process is different depending on where your Research Organisation (RO) is based. UK Co-Investigators should already be able to select their RO from the Je-S database. If you are based at an African RO, and have previously submitted an application to the MRC, your RO should also be listed on Je-S. If your RO has not previously submitted an application to the MRC, you must self-register your RO before you can start your application. This organisation self-registration process can be initiated by visiting the Je-S login page, and using the link highlighted in yellow below.

Following completion of the Overseas RO self-registration process, the overseas PI should navigate again to the Je-S login page to create their Je-S account via https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/JeS2WebLoginSite/CreateAccount.aspx.

Following the selection of the ‘Create an Account’ option, the Investigator will be asked to accept the terms and conditions of use of the Je-S System. Following this acceptance of Je-S T&Cs, the PI will be asked to complete a Je-S Account check (to ensure they do not already hold a Je-S Account). If no account exists for the Investigator, applicants are then advised to select the option to ‘Skip ORCID Identifier’ process (this can be requested at a later date, from within the created Je-S account).

Following selection of the ‘Skip ORCID identifier’, applicants should ensure they select the ‘Research Proposal’ account type applicable to An Applicant on a Standard or Outline Proposal (E.G. PI/Co-I).

Je-S Account applicants should then input their organisation and personal details and submit the request for an Je-S Account. Please note, accounts need to be activated (by the account holder), and accepted by Je-S Helpdesk, before the PI/Co-I is selectable from the Je-S Database.
Queries regarding Je-S RO Self-Registration, creation of Je-S Accounts and general Je-S enquiries, should be directed to the Je-S helpdesk via email (JeSHelp@je-s.ukri.org).
Investigators are advised to create their Je-S account as early as possible. PIs and Co-Is will need to create their own individual accounts on the Je-S system. Co-Is can then be added to the proposal and granted editor access by the PI. Please note, when the Co-I has been added to the Je-S application (as Co-Investigator), the Co-I will automatically receive Edit rights to the application (please note, Je-S does NOT allow multiple editors to edit the Je-S form at the same time).
Please contact the Je-S helpdesk if further guidance is required.
Creating your application on Je-S:
When you create your proposal in Je-S you will need to enter the following options to ensure that your proposal is considered under the correct funding scheme:
Select Council: MRC
Select Document Type: Standard Proposal
Select Scheme: Research Grant
Select Call/Type/Mode: African Research Leaders 2020

Please complete all sections of the application. General guidance can be found in the MRC Guidance for Applicants, which will guide you through the standard processes for preparing a proposal, costing your proposals and any ethical and regulatory requirements that may apply to the research.
Applications must be submitted through Je-S (to the MRC), by 16:00 (BST) on 8 September 2020.
Preparing the Case for Support:
The case for support is prepared as a separate attachment and should be a maximum of nineteen A4 sides in length, including references, using Arial 11 pt typeface with margins of 2cms on all sides. Applicants must follow the African Research Leader (ARL) Case for Support guidance when completing this section. Applicants are advised to also refer to the assessment criteria for the scheme.
Resources Requested:
All costs must be justified appropriately within your Justification of Resources attachment.
Please refer to the MRC Guidance for Applicants for costing of applications. Full financial details will be required. Please be reminded that this scheme is not primarily intended to support PhD studentships in obtaining their degree and PhD student fees will not be covered by the award.
Enter all costs requested, identifying the African and UK costs separately.
African costs 

Costs incurred by African research institutions are eligible for 100% FEC and these should be registered as 'Exceptions'.
Please also include details of the increasing commitment of the African research institution in taking on the Research Leader’s salary.
Capital items cannot be registered as exceptions however to claim 100% of this cost you should indicate that you are seeking the full amount from the Research Council.

UK costs 

Normal FEC rules (80%) will apply for UK costs.

A contribution towards the Estates and Indirect Costs (calculated as up to 20% of the African institution’s direct costs) can also be requested and should be included within the ‘Directly Incurred Other Costs’ section as ‘Exceptions’ and indicated as “Contribution towards African Research Institution’s Estates and Indirect Costs”.
For this scheme it is not necessary to obtain prior approval from the office for overseas exceptional costs. You are therefore not required to attach a covering letter to confirm this.
MRC institute costs
If the application involves an MRC institute, then it will only be eligible for directly incurred costs (at 100% FEC) as usual. Please refer to the appropriate section in the MRC Guidance for Applicants for costing of applications involving MRC units/institutes.
Further advice can be sought from the research support office at the unit/institute or alternatively contact the office.
Proposals involving animal use 
Please refer to the appropriate section in the MRC Guidance for Applicants. We ask all applicants to take into consideration the guidance set out in section 4 Proposals involving animal use.
MRC has published specific guidance on the requirements when using animals overseas.
Ethics and approvals:

Please refer to the scheme specific guidance in preparing your case for support.
Assessment process
Applications will be peer reviewed by external reviewers and considered by an independent expert Panel. Please see the specific assessment criteria for this scheme. The Panel will shortlist candidates for interview. The Co-I mentor from the UK partner institution will also be invited to the interview with the candidate for Research Leader.
The reviewers’ comments are fed back (verbatim but unattributed) to all candidates after the shortlisting process. Candidates whose proposals are shortlisted will have the opportunity to provide written comment on their reviewers’ feedback prior to the interview.
Shortlisted candidates will normally be notified four weeks before the interview date. Interviews will take place in March 2021 and it is highly likely that these will take place virtually. If the situation changes dramatically then face-to-face interviews will take place in London. Reasonable travel (economy class) and accommodation costs will be met by the MRC however it is the responsibility of candidates to ensure that they have the necessary visa to attend for the interview.
We reserve the right not to process an application if the scheme’s eligibility criteria and remit are not met or if the application has not been completed in full or is received after the submission deadline.
Monitoring and evaluation
Applicants are asked to note that there will be specific reporting requirements to monitor the progress of the ARL awards. One of the key facets of the scheme is the continued engagement with the funders. Further details will be provided following award.

Zoom details will be available one week before the webinar.
A call for proposals
Background
The MRC Public Health Intervention Development (PHIND) scheme was established to support the early stages of development of interventions that address an important UK or global public health issue. The aim of the scheme is to generate the necessary evidence to underpin the later development and evaluation of novel public health interventions. The PHIND scheme complements funding available from MRC Applied Global Health Research Board, NIHR and other sources for subsequent stages of public health intervention development and evaluation.
Remit
The scheme supports projects that will develop innovative new interventions that address an important UK or global public health issue.
Proposals should take a novel, high risk approach to intervention development. Population level interventions, with a focus on non-health care settings (such as: transport, education, employment, leisure and the built environment), are encouraged

“Population” is defined as a group of individuals an intervention may take place within, for example, schools, prisons, or larger communities and regions
Examples of the focus of population-level interventions include transport, education, employment, leisure and the built environment

Health care settings are not excluded, but projects should demonstrate potential for improved health of general, high risk or vulnerable populations.
For this call, applicants are encouraged to consider the incorporation of systems thinking in population-level intervention development research. To address public health challenges, such as air pollution, domestic violence and alcohol-related harm, public health interventions have to operate in a landscape that involves a wide array of people, organisations, structures and relationships[1]. There is a growing recognition that systems thinking and taking a systems-based approach, involving stakeholders from across the system, can help to ensure a more holistic approach to tackling public health issues. It is justifiable to focus on just one aspect of a system as long as the wider systems context is recognised, for example in the framework for evaluation.
Proposal criteria
Proposals should address the early stage of development of new interventions. This can include qualitative and quantitative primary research and the development of theory and logic models; however, emphasis should be placed on developing the intervention. Co-production with relevant stakeholders is strongly encouraged.
Within the application, the following should be addressed:

Definition of the intervention
Specification of the form(s) and function(s) of the intervention
Identification of the individual components of the intervention and their inter-relationships
a clear programme theory
how proposals should address continued refinements of interventions and sustainability
scalability of interventions

The creation of new interventions where active components of existing interventions are recombined to create a new intervention are allowed within the scope for this call.
Proposals should demonstrate a pathway to further development and evaluation of the proposed intervention and criteria for progression to the next stage of development should be detailed within the Case for Support.
Please refer to the 10 tips for writing a PHIND application, available in the Document Download section.
The following activities are not within the scope of this call:

NHS interventions
Interventions treating clinical conditions or improving health services delivery
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
Standalone feasibility studies and pilot studies
The wholesale transfer of a proven intervention to a new context, setting or target population

Funding
Applicants can apply for up to £150K (MRC contribution), for a maximum of 18 months. Funds may be requested to support costs attributable to the study including investigator and research staff time, consumables, equipment and travel.
The usual MRC funding and eligibility rules apply. Please see Guidance for applicants for information regarding eligibility.
A limited amount (approximately 15%) of the overall cost could be allocated to some acceptability and feasibility research, to further develop the intervention, help cement a collaboration or to underpin further work to help the case for a future grant application.
Assessment criteria and process
Applicants should consider carefully the following criteria which will be taken into account by the Expert Review Panel when assessing proposals:

The importance of the public health question and the need for an intervention to address the issue(s), taking account of the current landscape
The proposed approach including methodology, innovation and likelihood of the outcomes of the proposed study to fill a current gap in knowledge
The research team, research environment, stakeholder partners and user participation and engagement
How novel the intervention is and whether it brings together disciplines and actors that may not normally be involved in public health research
Impact:

Appropriate engagement plans with users and key stakeholders, such as policy makers, to accelerate impact
Appropriateness of communication and knowledge exchange plans

Experimental Medicine Funding Call

Time remaining:
1m 0w 6d 23h 59m
Status: Open
Open date: 29 Jul 2020
Closing date:
16 Sep 2020 16:00 GMT+1
Type: Grants, Researcher-led
Categories: 

Summary
You should address gaps in our understanding of the causes, progression and treatment of human disease through experimental intervention, or challenge, in humans.

Researchers at eligible organisations can submit proposals for academically-led projects.
Awards are made every year and there are deadlines every six months.
There will be an annual budget of £10million and we will support a range of award sizes

We generally fund 80% of the full economic costs of your research, and your research organisation must agree to find the balance.
Who can apply
You should be based at an eligible research organisation, which include:

higher education institutions
UKRI-approved independent research organisations or NHS bodies
government-funded organisations
MRC institutes
MRC units and partnership institutes
institutes and units funded by other research councils

Our general guidance for applicants contains more details on institutional and individual eligibility.
Investigators in receipt of Fellowships (MRC, NIHR, Charity, Learned Societies) and NIHR lectureships are eligible (if their fellowship T&Cs allow).
What we’re looking for
You can apply for academically-led experimental medicine projects, conducted in humans, based round a clearly articulated gap in understanding of human pathophysiology, with a clear path to clinical impact. These grants will produce new mechanistic insights, identifying opportunities to modify disease pathways and enabling novel therapeutic or diagnostic approaches for future development. 
All disease areas and interventions are welcomed by the Panel.
The application must involve an experimental intervention/challenge in humans, perturbing the system to explore disease mechanism. The challenge may be, but is not limited to, pharmacological, immunological, physiological, psychological, infectious etc.
The following types of proposals are eligible for support:

The use of novel readouts or technologies especially related to early evaluation of clinical efficacy.
The use of drugs, other interventions or measures with established safety profiles in new settings/conditions: e.g. repurposing drugs as tool compounds to probe disease mechanism.
Deep characterisation/phenotyping of subjects using samples from clinical studies may be included where there is a clear link to a current treatment strategy but should not be the sole focus of the proposal.

Acceptable approaches include the identification and verification of responder patient populations (precision medicine strategies).



Proposals which are predominantly descriptive will not be shortlisted; an experimental approach, and a clear plan for establishing causal relationships and mechanisms, is expected.
The following activities are ineligible for support:

Characterisation/ phenotyping work aiming to elucidate disease aetiology (supported by the Research Boards)
Experimental intervention/challenge in animals, using clinical assets to explore disease mechanisms and pathways (supported by the Research Boards)
Development and evaluation of novel therapeutics, diagnostics or devices (supported by DPFS)
High-throughput screening approaches to target validation
Pre-clinical model development and validation (supported by the Research Boards)
Clinical efficacy trials (supported by the EME funding scheme)

There is no limit to the amount of funding you can apply for or the length of your project. You should instead justify the timescale and resources needed in the context of the proposed work.
Collaborations
Applications including partnerships with charities or industry are encouraged where these add value to the project – for example, in terms of access to expertise, technologies, reagents or funding. Please note that industrial collaboration is not a prerequisite for application.
Applications involving collaboration with industry should adhere to the MRC Industry Collaboration Agreement guidance. The lead applicant must be the academic partner, and the project must be academically-led. Please note that we do not fund the work of your industrial partners.
How to apply
You must first submit an outline proposal via the Je-S website. The opportunity is open for seven weeks leading up to the deadline, and there are deadlines for outline proposals in September and December 2020.
When applying select:

Council: MRC
Document type: outline proposal
Scheme: Experimental Medicine
Call/type/mode: Exp Med: Sept 2020

You must use our outline proposal form for your Je-S application. Please read our guidance for outline stage applicants before applying.
If successful at the outline stage, you will be invited to submit a full application. We will send guidance on completing a full application.
We aim to complete the process from outline submission to full decision in approximately 30 weeks.

Where the research can take place
Studies funded through this scheme should be based in countries with low or middle income economies, excluding the exceptions listed below. World Bank definitions of low and middle income economies can be found at DAC List of ODA Recipients.
Exceptions: please note that from 2020/21 our partnerships with China and India have a renewed focus: applications involving China or India must have global or regional development impact as the primary objective, with local or national impacts within China or India as secondary objectives. 
Who can apply
This call is open to and particularly encourages applicants to apply from eligible research institutions based in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as well as the UK.
The scheme is targeted at trials led by academic groups, and not at trials led by commercial companies or product development partnerships (PDPs). However, applications are welcome from investigators from academic institutions who wish to collaborate with commercial companies or PDPs. Academic-industry collaborations will be considered under the MRC Industry Collaboration Agreement (MICA) mechanism - please see the MRC MICA web page for more information.
Principle Investigators
This scheme is open to Principal Investigators who are employed by eligible research institutions based in LMICs where the work will take place and to Principal Investigators who are employed by an eligible UK institution.
Applicants based in China or India are not eligible to be the Principal Investigator of an application to this call but are welcomed as international Co-Investigators within proposals. 
Eligible UK institutions include UK Higher Education Institutions, Research Council institutes, and eligible Independent Research Organisations (IROs). Further detail can be found on the UKRI eligibility web page.
Research Institutions based outside the UK will be asked to complete additional eligibility and financial checks before an award is offered, and awards will be dependent on satisfactory completion of those checks and on-going monitoring.
MRC units and institutes can apply to this call; usual rules for funding grants to MRC units and institutes will apply. If you are based at an MRC unit or institute, please contact your local MRC research support office for further information.
It is not permitted for the same person to be a Principal Investigator on more than two proposals submitted to this call.
Co-applicants and collaborators
The nature of this scheme means that we would expect applicants to be predominantly based in LMICs. Funding for co-applicants and collaborators in other regions can be requested, but we would expect that the majority of funds would support the costs in the LMIC where the trial will be conducted. Investigators employed by an institution in China, India or a high-income country outside the UK cannot be a Principal Investigator on a proposal but can be a Co-Investigator and are expected to make a significant contribution to their own research costs, including covering their own overheads.
Institutional support
Support is conditional on the host institution being able to demonstrate that they are able to conduct the trial to the standards set out in the MRC Guidelines for Management of Global Health Trials. Under this scheme it is expected that the host institute will be the sponsor of the trial. Support will be conditional on all required ethical, legal and regulatory approvals being obtained before the trial commences. Please note that ethics approval should be obtained from a UK ethics committee as well as in any countries hosting the trial.
Resubmissions
We are not able to accept resubmissions of proposals that have already been considered under this scheme. If you have substantially changed a previous proposal and wish to discuss whether it might be eligible, please contact JGHT@mrc.ukri.org.
Objective
The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for the best proposals to generate new knowledge about interventions that will contribute to the improvement of health in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The scheme is focused on late-stage clinical and health intervention trials evaluating efficacy and effectiveness.
Call 11 specifically invites applications for definitive randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that provide generalisable data, beyond a single country or setting. The evidence generated should be robust and relevant to international and regional policy makers and directly answer questions to change policy and guidance.
Priorities for this call
Trials should address the major causes of mortality or morbidity in LMICs, particularly those that affect the most vulnerable populations.
The scheme will give priority to proposals for definitive trials that are likely to produce implementable and generalisable results to change policy and practice. Stakeholders, such as policy makers, should be engaged throughout the research process in order to ensure trial results are implementable, scalable and in line with policy needs. All applications must include investigators/partners based in the country/ies where the trial will take place.
We are open to funding a smaller number of more ambitious trials than in previous years.
Methodology
The joint global health trials scheme funds RCTs, although nested studies and other types of methodologies can be used alongside RCTs to explore implementation and operational issues.
The scheme focuses on late-stage (equivalent to phase 3/4) clinical and health intervention trials that evaluate efficacy and effectiveness.
We encourage applications using adaptive trials designs and other innovative methodologies, where this is required to achieve the objectives of the evaluation. In all instances a clear justification for the chosen methodology must be provided and a clear reason for why the chosen trial design is likely to provide the most robust evidence to address the research question.
If there are outstanding questions on the trial design, we recommend that you consider applying for a smaller trial development grant first. This call launches on 8 September 2020, see ‘additional details’ section below for more information.
Intervention type
Although the breadth of the scheme is deliberately wide, we particularly welcome proposals for research addressing the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same individual as well as more broadly addressing chronic non- communicable diseases, including mental health, reproductive, maternal and new born health.
The scheme encourages the evaluation of a wide range of intervention types including, but not limited to:

behavioural interventions
psychological therapies
disease management
drugs
vaccines
hygiene interventions
diagnostic strategies.

Issues to consider which would strengthen your proposal

As the primary objective of this scheme is to develop and evaluate interventions with the potential for a significant impact on population health, applicants are encouraged to engage with local stakeholders and government and demonstrate buy-in where possible (for example through letters of support).
Applicants are encouraged to include social science and health economics expertise to ensure that the interventions are appropriate, acceptable and feasible to their target populations and that any potential social, cultural and economic barriers to implementation are examined.
Applicants should consider how the intervention could be implemented at scale. Where relevant, applicants should include implementation research in their proposals to provide lessons relevant to future scale-up.
Proposed trials should, as far as it is practicable, be fully developed and costed before they are allowed to start. Applications for full trials that require preliminary data should consider applying for a trial development grant first, see ‘additional details’ section below for more information.

Funding available
A total of up to £20 million is available for this call from the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Wellcome. The funders welcome trial proposals costed appropriately to provide definitive results. Around £1 million of the total budget is expected to be spent on several trial development grants.
You may request support for:

all research costs that are attributable to the trial. For example, appropriate percentages of the investigators’ time, scientific, technical and administrative staff including statisticians, research nurses, trial managers etc., consumables, items of equipment, data /sample handling and archiving and travel
the cost of holding trial steering and data monitoring committees
training and support for a trial manager
trial registration costs.

UK research will be funded at 74% of the Full Economic Cost (FEC). Research incurred by overseas Research Organisation and investigators is eligible to be funded at 100% of FEC.
Regulation, ethical review and liability may vary across different countries. Principal Investigators and proposed sponsors should ensure that they have adequately understood the feasibility and costs of participation of proposed international centres. For example, insurance arrangements will vary between countries and the sponsor (usually the host institution) is responsible for ensuring adequate arrangements are in place at each site.
How to apply
Applications will be submitted to and processed by MRC on behalf of the four partner agencies.
This call has a two stage application process: an obligatory outline stage and a full stage. Decisions for invitation to the full stage are expected in December 2020 with funding decisions expected in June 2021.
Please see the call specific guidance document for detailed information on how to apply. Applications which do not follow the guidance set out in this document may be rejected.
When applying select:

council: MRC
document type: Outline Proposal
scheme: MRC Jointly Funded Initiatives Outline
call/type/mode: MRC NIHR DfID Wellcome Global Health Trials Call 11 - Outline Oct 2020.

How we will assess your application
Applications will be considered by an expert panel convened specifically for this scheme jointly agreed by Medical Research Council, Department for International Development, Wellcome and National Institute Health Research. Additional scientific experts will be invited to provide written comments if the funders and/or Panel Chair deem this necessary.
The panel’s decision will be final and will not be open to appeal. Please ensure that all necessary information is incorporated in your application as there will not be an opportunity to add additional information after submission.

All enquiries should be directed in the first instance to the MRC: JGHT@mrc.ukri.org
Opportunities for Covid-19 related trials
Global Effort on COVID-19 Health Research is a new cross UK government funding call aiming to support applied health research that will address COVID-19 knowledge gaps. The focus is on understanding the pandemic and mitigating its health impacts in LMIC contexts. The call prioritises epidemiology, clinical management, infection control and health system responses.
The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator is a collaborative effort to research, develop and bring effective treatments to market quickly and accessibly. You can email the Therapeutics Accelerator for more information and to share your ideas.
Trial development grant funding
The scheme remains primarily a mechanism to support definitive trials. However, we recognise that preliminary work is often needed in order for applicants to develop innovative partnerships and trial proposals.
The aims of a trial development grant must be to address questions which need to be answered before a credible, competitive, definitive trial can be designed. Examples of work that a trial development grant can cover are:

studies to generate specific data that are needed to inform the trial design, such as to determine the sample size, outcome measures, recruitment strategy, follow-up strategy, appropriate monitoring activities and timings
work to understand the likelihood of contamination within the trial for example in a cluster randomised trial, and how that contamination might be handled
work to inform the design of the trial intervention, for instance feasibility and acceptability issues in a public health intervention, and pre- trial simulations
trial development grant funding cannot be used in this scheme for drug, vaccine, device, diagnostic or other biomedical intervention development. This means that activities such as drug discovery research, preclinical and early phase 1 and 2 clinical studies are ineligible for funding through this scheme. However, it would be appropriate to use a trial development grant to address trial feasibility questions such as the best way to provide a particular drug within a specific context or population.

The trial development grant route requires a single application step (there is no outline stage). The call will be launched in October 2020 and call specific guidance provided. Please note, trial development grant applications are expected to be up to two years duration and up to £200k. Around £1 million of the budget is expected to support multiple trial development grants.
Funding Partners
Together we will fund up to £20 million for the 11th round launched under the Joint Global Health Trials partnership.
Terms and conditions
Funded grants will be managed according to UKRI’s standard terms and conditions. In addition, DfID, MRC, Wellcome and NIHR require that all trials funded by this scheme are run according to the MRC guidelines for management of global health trials.

Remit
The Applied Global Health Research Board supports research that will be of direct and primary benefit to the health of vulnerable populations living in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Applied research is defined as research seeking practical solutions to health challenges from late stage intervention development onwards. This includes implementation research, scale-up activities, health services research, health economics, health policy research, and research with a predominantly applied focus that does not fit within the remit of other MRC Boards and Panels.
The Board also welcomes cross-sector research combining expertise to meet a global health challenge (e.g., urban planning, health policy, and non-communicable disease research within a single proposal). The research question might necessitate the involvement of different disciplines and approaches from outside of the health sector, but the primary objective must be health focused.
Examples of areas in which applied research may be conducted include, but are not limited to, the following health topics and focus areas:

Maternal and neonatal health;
Child health and early childhood development;
Adolescent health;
Healthy ageing;
Sexual and reproductive health;
Infectious diseases, including neglected tropical diseases;
Non-communicable diseases, including mental health;
Multimorbidity;
Nutrition and food security;
Snakebite;
Intentional and unintentional injury;
Urban health, including indoor/outdoor air pollution, road traffic accidents, and healthy housing;
Planetary health;
Informal settlements, conflict zones, and displaced populations;
Primary, secondary and tertiary prevention;
Detection and diagnostics;
mHealth;
Treatment, including surgery;
Pain management and palliative care.

The following areas are outside of the Board’s funding remit:

Discovery research, and research that includes an applied component that fits within a current Board or Panel remit, including early translation;
Health systems research within the remit of the DFID/ESRC/MRC/Wellcome Health Systems Research Initiative;
Large-scale clinical trials (i.e., within MRC Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme remit if Phase I/II, or MRC-DFID-Wellcome-NIHR Joint Global Health Trials remit if Phase III/IV);
Global public health intervention development up to £150,000 and led by a UK PI (within Public Health Intervention Development scheme remit). Proposals costing more than £150,000 or led by an LMIC PI are eligible to apply to the Board;
Vaccine development research (i.e., within the Infections and Immunity Board and Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme remits).

We recommend that you contact the office prior to applying to determine fit to remit. Please forward a one-page summary of the aims and research plans/methodology of your project to International@mrc.ukri.org where a member of the team will be able to assess whether your application will be suitable for the board.
Funding available
The resources requested should be commensurate with the objectives of the proposal. All sizes of applications, including large applications over £1m - and small to medium scale applications will be accepted. Value for money will be taken into account by the Board when assessing proposals.
Three grant schemes are available through the Board:

Research Grant
Programme Grant
Partnership grant

The above links provide information on the scale and type of activities that fall within each of the grant schemes. Applicants should also refer to:

MRC Guidance for Applicants for standard information on how to apply, who can apply, and costs that can be claimed.
The Applied Global Health Research Board ‘our science and contacts’ page and supplementary guidance for applicants for tailored information specific to this Board.

Eligibility
Applications are particularly encouraged from LMIC Principal Investigators (PI’s), as well as PI’s based in the UK working in equitable partnerships with LMIC investigators.
Institutions based in China or India are not eligible to lead applications to this funding opportunity but are welcomed as collaborating organisations hosting Co-Investigators within proposals. This reflects that from 2020/21 the UK’s partnerships with China and India under the Global Challenges Research Fund and our other ODA funding have a renewed focus: partnerships with Co-Investigators from China or India must have global or regional development impact as the primary objective, with local or national impacts within China or India as secondary objectives. It is expected that Co-Investigators from China and India make a significant contribution to their own research costs, including covering their own overheads in line with the rules set out for HIC costs.
LMIC PIs must be based at a higher education institution, non-profit research institution, or non-governmental organisation with sufficient research capacity to manage and deliver research. LMIC Co-Investigators (Co-I’s) can be based at the aforementioned organisations or at an implementing partner, including government ministries. Applicants should check with their Research Office whether previous applications have been awarded by MRC or UKRI. If they have not, applicants should contact international@mrc.ukri.org to determine eligibility prior to submitting their application.
It is not permitted for the same person to be a PI on more than two proposals at any one time. You may support others as a Co-I, as long as you have the capacity to do so without detriment to the project you lead.
Researchers based in high income countries (HIC) outside of the UK may be Co-Is provided the HIC costs requested do not exceed 30% of the proposed total.
Funding for the Board forms part of the UK’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitment. Applications must demonstrate the research to be primarily relevant and directly linked to near-term benefits to the health and economic development of the poorest and most vulnerable populations within LMICs, as defined by the OECD DAC list (except for China and India). Where countries have been identified as likely to graduate from the DAC list in the near future, funding may not be granted). Applications should articulate a clear and specific case for the relevance of the proposed research to these LMIC populations and identify and provide evidence that the proposed plan of research is informed by the needs of the LMIC.
How to apply
All applications to the board must be submitted through the (Je-S) system (to the MRC), by 16:00 (BST) on 13 October 2020.

Application process
Proposals are assessed in a two-stage process. The first step involves review of an outline proposal. Successful outline applicants are invited to submit a full proposal, which undergoes external peer review before a further, more detailed, review by the Board. The total assessment time for a proposal submitted to MRC, from outline deadline to full decision, is approximately nine months.
Board opportunities
There are two types of Board opportunity:

Ring-fenced opportunities deliver a defined financial commitment to a specific area of focus.
Prioritised opportunities are areas of strategic interest that are used to inform funding discussions at the Board meeting.

Board opportunities represent areas of specific strategic focus that help to inform discussions at funding meetings but note that applicants are welcome to submit research proposals focusing on any applied global health topic. Further information on the scope and remit of each of the Board opportunities is provided via the links below. This information must be consulted prior to applying, especially as the specific areas of focus within each board opportunity are likely to change from one round to the next.
Ring-fenced opportunities
Maternal and Neonatal Health
In 2019, MRC and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) launched a call for proposals in Global Maternal and Neonatal Health based on extensive consultation with stakeholders in the UK and LMICs. This consultation was formalised in the MRC-NIHR Overview of Global Maternal and Neonatal Health Research Priorities, which continues to inform MRC activity in this area. From April 2020 onwards, applications addressing maternal and neonatal health should be submitted to the Board and will not be supported by separate funding calls.
Further information about this Board Opportunity, including specific application guidance, can be found here.
Prioritised opportunities
Early Childhood Development
The Board supports research in Early Childhood Development (ECD), a recent area of focus that bridges the gap between neonatal health and adolescent health, during a critical period where health and education intersect. Proposals funded in this area will be co-funded by the UK Department for International Development as part of a coordinated effort to increase and scale up the evidence-base for ECD interventions.
Further information about this Board Opportunity, including specific application guidance, can be found here.
Adolescent Health
Adolescent Health has been a recent focus of investment for MRC and DFID (via the MRC-DFID concordat) and NIHR, in partnership with ESRC for applied research that addressed the health needs of adolescent populations in LMICs. The focus of these calls was developed in line with the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents guidance. From now on, applications addressing adolescent health should be submitted to the Board and will not be supported by separate funding calls.
Further information about this Board Opportunity, including specific application guidance, can be found here
Implementation science
Maximising impact from research remains a priority for the MRC. To ensure that this priority is met, the Board aims to fund research to address the implementation gap and progress interventions towards real world impact. This complements existing applied global health schemes addressing late phase trials and health systems research, by providing a regular funding opportunity for research utilising robust implementation science approaches. The research is expected to ensure that evidence-based health interventions are implemented in an accessible and equitable way for the poorest and most vulnerable populations living in LMICs.

Clinical Academic Research Partnerships Round 3: Announcement

Time remaining:
2m 2w 5d 23h 58m
Status: Open
Open date: 7 Aug 2020
Closing date:
29 Oct 2020 16:00 GMT
Type: Grants, Researcher-led
Categories: Infections and immunity, Molecular and cellular medicine, Population and systems medicine, Neurosciences and mental health, Translation, Global health, Methodology, Public health

Before submitting a proposal, please ensure you have thoroughly read the guidance available. Proposals which do not include the required components, or which are not formatted according to the guidance will not be considered.
We recommend applicants consider the Chair’s summaries from Round 1 and Round 2 of the pilot.
Aim
A strong multidisciplinary academic workforce is critical to the delivery of many aspects of the Life Sciences Industrial Strategy, in addition to the Medical Research Council (MRC) core mission of carrying out research for patient benefit. As team science approaches to scientific challenges increase, so does the need for the skills and experience to underpin effective collaborations across disciplines, institutions and sectors.
As part of a strong clinical academic workforce, healthcare professionals are uniquely positioned to contribute to research. Clinical contact enables them to identify emerging research needs and to understand the areas that will make the most difference to patients. It affords them a practical understanding of how to translate research into patient benefit in day-to-day practice. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that healthcare professionals remain involved in research at all levels.
This scheme provides a new flexible route for research-qualified healthcare professionals at consultant level or equivalent to increase their research skills and experience by engaging with groups and centres of biomedical and health research excellence, enabling the cross-seeding of perspectives, ideas and connections needed to underpin future translational biomedical and health research.
Working in partnership, the MRC and the National Institute for Health Research are committing at least £6 million, from which it is anticipated 20-25 awards will be made.
Scope
The scheme provides a mechanism for healthcare professionals at consultant level or equivalent with a PhD, or MD (or equivalent postgraduate qualification) who are not undertaking any substantive research activity but, wish to develop their research interests through collaborative high-quality research partnerships with established leading biomedical and health researchers.
Applicants
This scheme is open to applicants across the UK. Applicants should  be a member of NHS staff or staff contracted to the NHS or working in the public health or care sector (doctors, dentist, nurses, midwives, allied health professions, healthcare scientists, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, registered public health practitioners, and others), in either primary care, secondary care, community care or public health.
Applicants should be working at consultant-level or equivalent. Individuals should be working at a senior level, holding specialized knowledge and will have demonstratable capacity for professional independence/leadership. Applicants must hold a PhD/MD or equivalent postgraduate qualification, for example ~3 years consolidated research time, where the applicant had been the intellectual drive behind a project and obtained strong outputs from their research experience.
There are no eligibility rules based on time since applicants obtained their PhD/MD etc, however within their current posts, applicants should not be currently undertaking any substantive research activity. Applicants will generally have no or very limited research funding. It is expected that most applicants will have less than one PA of research time in their current job plan. Applicants who have more than one research PA or have not had a significant break in research activity will need to articulate the added-value of the award, for example how this scheme will put them on a research trajectory they were not currently on and why this scheme is a more suitable option compared to other schemes they are eligible for.
Applicants without a significant break in research activity are encouraged to investigate other existing schemes, for example: MRC’s Clinician Scientist Fellowship or NIHR’s Advanced Fellowship.
Applications declined as part of the pilot scheme may be resubmitted. However, the new application must be substantially different from the previous, unsuccessful submission and you will need to include a covering letter with your new proposal, indicating how the application has been changed. Please refer to MRC Guidance regarding resubmissions.
Research partners
Research partners must have a proven track record of securing peer-reviewed research programmes from funders such as UKRI, NIHR, or significant third sector research funders for the duration of the planned partnership. They must also be based at an organisation eligible to hold research council funding. Further information on eligible organisations can be found on the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) website.
Projects
Projects are welcome across all areas of the partnering funders’ remits and interests. Applications may range from basic discovery science to translational and applied health research, and may address research questions from disease-specific mechanistic hypotheses through to research in priority areas such as primary care, population health, public health, mental health, molecular pathology and other areas as outlined in  MRC's strategic plan. Applications addressing global health issues resulting in primary benefit to those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), or those proposing interdisciplinary approaches are also welcomed. The proposed project should be tailored to the interests of and expertise of the applicant and research partner and designed to provide a mutually beneficial collaboration for both parties.
Institutional support required
The NHS organisation (or equivalent) that employs the applicant must provide an upfront commitment on protected research time and a commitment to ensuring that the awardee can re-enter the clinic full-time without any loss of career progression/status at the end of the award. The academic organisation must demonstrate appropriate support (such as access to facilities) to enable the applicant to successfully undertake the project described. Letters of support should be personalised and include clear and feasible plans for the applicant’s time to be backfilled, especially for applicants from niche specialties where this will present a challenge.
We will ask to see a copy of the applicant's job plan as a condition of the award.
Funding available
Awards are flexible to enable applicants to tailor the support requested to their individual collaborative plans.
Awards will be a minimum of one year and maximum of three years in duration. Each award will support between 20-50% of the applicant’s basic salary to support protected research time, and costs for consumables to undertake the project. No additional support for salaries may be requested.
At least £6 million is available, from which it is anticipated 20-25 awards will be made. There is no limit to the total support an application can request, but applicants should be mindful of the budget available and anticipated number of awards. All awards will be on the basis of Full Economic Costing.
Review
Applications are assessed in a two-stage process: external peer review, shortlisting, and assessment at a funding meeting. For more information please see our peer review guidance.
All applications are subject to an early suitability assessment, ahead of external peer review. Applications outside the remit of the scheme will be rejected.
Proposals will be assessed on:

the track record of the research partner, including their funding and productivity to date, and ability to offer a strong environment to host the applicant;
evidence of the research capabilities of the applicant, as demonstrated by the productivity and skills gained during their PhD or MD, and any other past research experience if applicable;
alignment of the project to research strengths and interests of the applicant and research partner;
demonstration of the project providing a mutually beneficial collaboration, enhancing the applicant’s research experience and contribution they can make to the research partner’s existing team;
strength of the institutional support provided, including the facilities and experience the research partner can provide, and strength of support from the employing NHS organisation.

UKRI open call for research and innovation ideas to address Covid-19

Time remaining:
4m 3w 1d 0h 16m
Status: Open
Open date: 31 Jul 2020
Closing date:
31 Dec 2020 16:00 GMT
Type: Grants, Researcher-led
Categories: Infections and immunity, Molecular and cellular medicine, Population and systems medicine, Neurosciences and mental health, Translation, Methodology, Public health


Proposals are invited for short-term projects addressing and mitigating the health, social, economic, cultural and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Since we opened this competition in March 2020 the research and innovation community have responded with some excellent ideas and proposals. Sadly, Covid-19 is still with us, and robust solutions to many problems are still needed. That said, there are some areas that are already well funded, and others where few high-quality proposals have been submitted. For this reason, for this next phase of the call, we will focus on areas that fill gaps in the Covid-19 research and innovation landscape.
We have developed a priority list of areas which we are particularly interested in seeing addressed. These will be updated periodically. It’s important that applicants also check what projects are already in progress.
On Friday 31 July the application process changed. Application to the research councils is via the Joint Electronic Submission (Je-S) system.
Please note that although the call for research proposals is being hosted on Je-S by EPSRC, and will show the EPSRC logo in some places, the call remains UKRI wide. Your proposal will still be assessed by the most appropriate council(s).

Please see the UKRI website for more information.
