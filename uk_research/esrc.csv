Summary
Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) is pleased to announce an open competition for the creation of an International Public Policy Observatory to support public policy decision-makers in developing effective strategies for responding to and recovering from the social, economic and public health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. ESRC intends to fund the Observatory for an initial period of two years to enable a rapid response to current urgent evidence need and to generate evidence about the effectiveness of this new model to inform further investment decisions.
Scope
The International Public Policy Observatory (IPPO) will provide research and evidence to inform public policy decision-makers in developing effective strategies for responding to and recovering from the social, economic and public health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. It will work through collaboration and co-production with policy actors, researchers and centres of excellence in the UK and internationally, the ESRC and other funders. IPPO will increase understanding of the range and effectiveness of interventions and public policy responses to the pandemic. To achieve this, it will:

collate, analyse and synthesise evidence on the range and potential effectiveness of policies being implemented, including and especially beyond the UK, providing access to and insights into this evidence in ways which respond directly to the needs of policy actors; this will require providing insights into the potential transferability to the UK context of other countries’ interventions
facilitate new connections and enable rapid direct access to national and international expertise for policy actors
over time support commissioning of new research to feed into policy decisions and future funding strategy where key gaps in evidence or quality are identified

The range of policy areas to be covered in its work will include: education; mental health and wellbeing; care homes and adult social care; housing, communities and cohesion; addressing disproportionate impacts on BAME groups; vulnerable individuals and communities; and living online. Given the dynamic and wide-ranging nature of the policy need, the Observatory will need to deploy an iterative, phased and demand-led approach to prioritising within and across these public policy areas through close collaboration with key policy stakeholders and ESRC. For all policy areas, the Observatory will need to address tackling inequalities and harnessing behavioural change, where there is evidence that can be exploited on these themes.
Funding and eligibility
The ESRC will be investing up to £2 million at 100% full economic cost (fEC) in one award through this call. The fEC value refers to the total cost of the project, and is not the actual contribution paid by the ESRC. The ESRC’s contribution for UK applicants for most cost headings is 80% of fEC. These will not include the costs for any research commissioned in association with the Observatory, which will be supported through a separate fund.
All proposals to this call must be led by a researcher at an eligible UK Research Organisation (RO); see the UKRI website for a list of eligible organisations. All proposals to this call will need to be submitted through the Research Councils’ Joint Electronic Submission (Je-S) system. The deadline for submissions is no later than 16.00 15 September 2020. Proposals will be assessed by a panel of academic and policy experts and shortlisted applicants will be interviewed w/c 5 October 2020. The interview date will be confirmed to all applicants when the call closes. The successful applicant will be required to submit a full proposal formally through the Research Councils’ Joint Electronic Submission (Je-S) system in October 2020.

Research Centres are major ESRC strategic investments. In addition to taking forward an ambitious research agenda and making significant economic and/or societal impact, they add value by increasing research infrastructure, building capacity, encouraging interdisciplinary working in social science and beyond, and enabling research collaboration in the UK and internationally.
Research Centre funding is aimed at experienced research leaders who require longer-term or extended support for research groups, inter-institutional research networks, programmes of research, medium to large surveys, other infrastructure or methodological developments, or any related larger-scale projects. Research Centres also have a distinct role in supporting the development of early career researchers and building new research capacity. They are expected to be high-impact investments over the longer term.
The Centres 2020 competition is open to applications of excellent quality in any area of social science within the ESRC remit. The call also includes a highlight notice in the area of Changing Populations, in particular ‘Connecting Generations’.
The ESRC will be investing up to £45m 100% full economic cost (fEC) over five years through the open element of this Centres Competition, with up to a further £10m 100% fEC for the highlight notice. The competition is for proposals ranging from £2.5 million to £10 million 100% fEC with a term of up to five years. ESRC will meet 80% of the full economic costs on proposals submitted. It is anticipated that ESRC will fund up to five Centres under the open call and a further Centre under the highlight notice. All proposals to this call must be led by a researcher at an eligible UK Research Organisation (RO) and will need to be submitted through the Research Councils’ Joint Electronic Submission (Je-S) system.
We anticipate considerable interest in this competition which will be run as a two-stage application process and, as in previous competitions, we have asked ROs to limit the number of applications to support the most competitive bids. We will be looking for evidence of long-term institutional commitment, including additional financial resources from the RO to extend the work programme beyond the 100% fEC funding requested.
Highlight notice
Dedicated funds are available to support a Centre in the area of Changing Populations, in particular ‘Connecting Generations’. It is our expectation that the successful Centre will seek to address aims set out under the Changing Populations priority area of the ESRC 2019 Delivery Plan (https://www.ukri.org/files/about/dps/esrc-dp-2019/) and specifically fulfil our commitment to a Connecting Generations programme that stimulates excellent research that will inform policy and practice by expanding the evidence base on how changes in our population, society and economy influence the connections and inequalities between generations.

The Joint Programming Initiative ""More Years Better Lives - The Potential and Challenges of Demographic Change (JPI MYBL), is a pan-European and Canadian intergovernmental initiative gathering European countries and Canada to jointly coordinate European and national research programmes related to demographic change and fund new transnational research initiatives. Areas affected by demographic change cover a wide range of research fields and policy topics ranging from health to social welfare, education and learning, work and productivity to housing, urban and rural development and mobility.
Call for Proposals
Following a pre-announcement earlier in the year, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), alongside ten other European and Canadian funding organisations, is pleased to invite applications for the Equality and Wellbeing across Generations (EWG) funding opportunity. This is a call which has been developed under the JPI MYBL.
The EWG call is now open and the deadline for applications is 14 September 2020 at 17:00 Central European Time (CET).
Major demographic changes are taking place across Europe and Canada and these changes can increase inequality, bringing greater opportunities for some people but fewer opportunities for others. One key change is in the relationship between generations, where historical assumptions about mutual responsibilities and benefits may no longer be valid. The EWG joint transnational call invites researchers to submit proposals that will enhance our understanding of: 

How demographic change is altering the implicit contract between generations?
How policy can ensure that change results in a reduction in inequality?

The call aims to support policy in reducing inequality in the face of demographic change, specifically three aspects of inequality:

Income and wealth
Caring responsibilities
Social and political participation

In addressing these topics, we expect proposals to pay particular attention to cross-cutting issues of gender, cultural background[1] and socio-economic background, all of which have a major bearing on inequalities.
UK applicants are permitted to address all three topics and all three cross-cutting issues set out in the scope of the call.
Funding
A total contribution of approximately 6,736,000€ will be provided by the eleven national funding agencies. The UK budget for this call is approximately 1,120,000€ and it is anticipated that three to six projects with UK components will be funded. ESRC will provide funding for 80% of the Full Economic Cost (fEC) of the UK components of successful projects.
Call Documents
The Call will be administered via the Belgium Science Policy Office (BELSPO). Applicants should refer to the EWG website in order to register for access to the Electronic Submission Platform. On the website, applicants will also find the Guidelines for Applicants document. UK applicants should pay particular attention to the UK annex within this document.  
Please note that successful UK applicants will be asked to submit their proposal through UKRI’s Joint Electronic System (Je-S) when the funding decisions had been made, in order for ESRC to administer the Awards. To reduce the administrative burden on applicants during the initial application stage, applicants will not be required to upload additional UK-specific attachments to the Electronic Submission Platform at this time, except for the ’UK Funding Template – Mandatory Attachment’ which can be found on the Platform.
Partnering Tool and Submission Platform
The EWG website includes a platform, which acts as a partnering tool and a submission platform. Through this tool prospective applicants can identify collaborators in other countries that are participating in the call. Interested parties can post their expertise and indicate that they are looking to join a collaboration, or they can put out a request for particular expertise that they require as part of a collaboration they are forming. The tool can also be used to identify and connect with relevant stakeholders.
At the same time this platform will be used to build and submit your application. The platform has been built especially for this call and is very user-friendly. The recorded webinar gives you a detailed walk through of the platform and it’s functionality. 
Expression of Interest (EOI)
The call has a non-compulsory EOI stage. We encourage applicants considering submitting a proposal to this call to add basic information, such as their name, keywords and disciplines, onto the Electronic Submission Platform by 14 August 2020.  This will help the funders to find suitable experts to assess the proposals.
Relevance of COVID-19
The funders acknowledge the relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic to the topic of this call. The pandemic has brought a refreshed focus on the relationship and inequalities between and within generations and on the responsibilities of generations to one another. The virus and the measures put in place to stop its spread are having differential impacts both between and within generations. This includes in key areas of daily life that are addressed as topics of this call - income and wealth, caring responsibilities, and social and political participation. The primary focus of proposals to this call should be the research topics and cross-cutting issues set out in the call scope. However, proposals can, and where appropriate should, recognise the COVID-19 pandemic as an important contextual factor in the research that is proposed.
If you missed our webinar, you can still view the recording.

2018-2021 Call Specification: Invite only
Tranche 4
ESRC and DFID are pleased to announce that Tranche 4 of the RLO Follow-on Fund 2018- 2021 call is open to all RLO Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators, both past and present. The call is focussed on impact enhancement, research augmentation, capacity building (workstreams 1-3) and cross-grant synthesis (workstream 4) activities, which build on their existing RLO grant.
This invitation-only call will be open twice a year, in bi-annual tranches (usually opened every six months) for the next two years. The fourth bi-annual tranche will open 12 May 2020 and close 16:00 (UK time) on 22 September 2020. In response to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on research and the research community, the fourth tranche of this call will be open for a longer period than previous tranches. It is intended that the final tranche will open in May 2021, however the timing of remaining tranches will continue to be reviewed in response to the evolving situation regarding the global pandemic. Up to £2 million has been allocated for the length of the call.
The call is open to any Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-Investigator (Co-I) who has held a research grant funded within the RLO programme. Co-Is who wish to apply as a PI to this Follow-on Fund call must have the express support of their original RLO grant’s PI.The original grant can be open or closed at the point that the application(s) are made and they will be awarded as separate grant(s) to the existing/completed RLO grant. Any researcher who has not been a PI or Co-I on an RLO-funded grant is not eligible to apply. All uninvited or ineligible applications will be rejected.
In workstreams 1-3 (impact enhancement, research augmentation, capacity building) proposals are invited for grants with a full economic cost (fEC) value of between £25,000 and £100,000 for either workstream, or for any combination of these three workstreams. Researchers are eligible to apply for a number of these grants, on multiple occasions, however the total amount of all awarded grants linked to the original proposal must not in sum exceed £100,000. Note that whilst cross-grant learning (where appropriate for inclusion) will be viewed positively in workstream 1 to 3, it is not a requirement for these workstreams and proposals within these workstreams must stand alone i.e. they cannot be co/inter dependent.
In workstream 4 (cross-grant synthesis) proposals are invited from RLO researchers working in collaboration with other RLO grants. These proposals must also have a fEC value of between £25,000 and £100,000. Researchers can also apply for a number of these grants, on multiple occasions, and can collaborate with different projects in these applications. The funders are keen to encourage applications to workstream 4. Therefore in addition to the maximum of £100k allocable per grant in workstreams 1-3, a further £100k may be allocated to original RLO grants against workstream 4 (this makes a maximum of £200k across all 4 workstreams).
Projects may be up to a maximum of 2 years in duration. The call has been designed so that all grants will get an equal chance to access this additional funding if and when they are ready to do so.  Proposals can be submitted at any point whilst each tranche of the call is open, but will not be assessed until the submission window has closed.

The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), is pleased to issue a pre-call announcement for the appointment of a Scientific Leadership and Delivery Team to develop and deliver an Early Life Cohort pilot study.
We intend to announce the full call for proposals in Autumn 2020. This notice is being issued now to allow potential applicants time for the early development of proposals, partnerships and collaborations in advance of the formal call for proposals.
Background
Since the 1940s, the UK has accumulated a globally leading set of rich birth cohort datasets that have enabled the understanding of many aspects of the lives of previous generations of children as they were growing up, and allowed researchers to relate experiences in childhood to experiences and outcomes in adulthood. These datasets provide a shared valuable research resource for scientists, practitioners, and policy makers from across the globe and continue to enable world leading research which has had considerable scientific and real-world impact.
Whilst these studies continue to provide scientifically valuable data, the existing UK studies cover cohorts of participants born up to the millennium. The lives of future generations of children growing up in the UK, shaped by factors including the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, will look very different to those of past generations, meaning there is a pressing need for an innovative new early life cohort study.
The independent Longitudinal Studies Strategic Review (https://esrc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/publications/corporate-publications/longitudinal-studies-review-2017/) for ESRC recommended that ESRC commission a new birth cohort. The scoping of a new birth cohort was also identified as a priority in the ESRC Delivery Plan (https://www.ukri.org/files/about/dps/esrc-dp-2019/) and the UKRI Infrastructure Roadmap (https://www.ukri.org/research/infrastructure/).
Since publishing the Longitudinal Studies Strategic Review, the ESRC has carried out scoping work to inform a new birth cohort including commissioning reports on aspects of its possible design and methodology and discussions with relevant organisations about sampling options. The reports are available on the ESRC website (https://esrc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/publications/corporate-publications/innovation-and-development-in-longitudinal-studies-outputs-from-the-uk-population-lab-programme/).
This scoping work and strategic advice has demonstrated the value of a pilot study in informing the commissioning and design of the full early life cohort. In addition, this pilot study would directly gather new data for research and support innovation in design and data collection.
ESRC has convened an advisory group of independent experts, chaired by Professor Melinda Mills (University of Oxford) to provide advice to the ESRC on the specification, commissioning, oversight and evaluation of the pilot study.
Scope
The ESRC will commission a Scientific Leadership and Delivery Team to develop and deliver an Early Life Cohort pilot study. The successful bid will involve effective collaborations between the Scientific Leadership and Delivery team and partners including end-users.
The core purpose of the pilot study will be to:

Demonstrate the feasibility of a full early life cohort
Develop and test innovations in data collection or other methodological issues which can be employed in or inform the full study
Undertake substantive longitudinal data collection, to justify the public investment and participation in the work

It is intended that the pilot will be longitudinal, involving two or more rounds of data collection.
Further information regarding the scope of the call, including the funding available, will be released when the call launches in Autumn 2020.
Eligibility
Standard ESRC eligibility rules will apply for the upcoming call.
For further information please see ESRCs’ Research Funding Guide (https://esrc.ukri.org/funding/guidance-for-applicants/research-funding-guide/)
If in doubt of eligibility, please refer to the FAQs which can be downloaded from the ESRC website: (https://esrc.ukri.org/files/funding/funding-opportunities/faq-centres-competition-2020/) or contact the office.
Principal investigators
Principal investigators (PIs) on proposals to the call must be based at a UK institution eligible for Research Council funding; see the UKRI website for a list of eligible organisations (https://www.ukri.org/funding/how-to-apply/eligibility/).
It is likely that successful applications will be led by experienced researchers who are internationally recognised and have a well-established track record within their field, as well as proven ability to deliver a large-scale longitudinal study successfully.

Collaborative and consortium bids are encouraged for this call. The amount of time committed to the grant by the PI and co-investigators must be costed into the proposal. Standard ESRC research funding rules will apply for staff engaged in more than one ESRC grant (see ESRC Research Funding Guide, page 27: www.esrc.ukri.org/funding/guidance-for-applicants/research-funding-guide).
The inclusion of international co-investigators in proposals is welcome. However, please note that academic researchers (at PhD or equivalent status) must be from established overseas research organisations of comparable standing to ESRC-eligible UK research organisations to be listed as international co-investigators under this call.
International collaboration is not limited to co-investigators but may also involve partnerships to develop international datasets, promote knowledge exchange and international impact, and enhance development on an international scale. Further guidance on the inclusion of international co-investigators is available at https://esrc.ukri.org/funding/guidance-for-applicants/inclusion-of-international-co-investigators-on-proposals/.
We also welcome inter-institutional applications and strongly encourage partnerships with non-HEI organisations and the inclusion of third sector, business and public sector coinvestigators (see https://esrc.ukri.org/funding/guidance-for-applicants/inclusion-of-uk-business-third-sector-or-government-body-co-investigators-on-proposals/).

Pre-call Announcement for a Scientific Leadership and Delivery Team to deliver an Early Life Cohort pilot study


",https://esrc.ukri.org/funding/funding-opportunities/development-of-a-pilot-for-an-early-life-cohort-study/,
"
UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the State of São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) have agreed a pioneering Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to welcome, encourage and support applications that may cut across their national boundaries and involve international collaborative teams.
The UKRI-FAPESP Memorandum of Understanding (UKRI website) underpins a 'Lead Agency Agreement' whereby the relevant UK research council will receive and assess collaborative proposals from eligible institutions on behalf of both organisations. FAPESP-nominated experts will be involved with the peer review and decision-making processes throughout.
ESRC accepts applications under the terms of the MoU to our Research Grants scheme.
Collaborative research proposals may be submitted in any area of the social sciences within the remit of both the ESRC and FAPESP. There is no deadline, and proposals will be accepted on an ongoing basis until expiry of the MoU on 31 December 2020. 
Collaborative research proposals should be submitted to the ESRC and FAPESP, although the ESRC will take the lead role in processing and assessing applications with input from FAPESP. A decision on ESRC-FAPESP proposals will be made by the ESRC's Research Committee, within its normal standard grants competition. Those proposals approved for funding will be jointly supported by the ESRC and FAPESP.
Please note that the ESRC does not allow the resubmission of any previously unsuccessful proposals (including proposals previously submitted to another Research Council), unless applicants have been explicitly invited to do so. Please therefore ensure your proposal is of the highest quality possible upon first submission.
Applicants should note the following in preparing their application:
Eligibility

In order to receive support from FAPESP, the Brazilian partners must be based at an institution eligible for their support. These are higher education and research organisations, public or non-profit in the State of São Paulo.
Before submitting an application, the Brazilian principle investigator (PI) should contact FAPESP to confirm their eligibility. For eligible applicants, FAPESP will provide a letter confirming eligibility which should be attached to the joint funding application submitted to FAPESP (SAGe) and ESRC (Je-S).
UK applicants should comply with the eligibility requirements outlined for ESRC’s standard responsive mode.

Submission and Budget

Applications should first be submitted by the Brazilian PI to FAPESP via SAGe before the application is submitted to the ESRC via Je-S. This is so the SAGe application can be submitted as an attachment to the ESRC Je-S submission.
For UK-based applicants, the proposal should be submitted via Je-S to the Research Grants (Open Call). The costs being requested from ESRC for the UK part of the project should be a minimum of £350,000, and no more than £1,000,000 (at 100% Full Economic Cost). 
Please note that for FAPESP, the budget should be in line with FAPESP funding rules of the chosen scheme. FAPESP applicants do not need to request equal amounts from both sides. The difference in values should reflect the difference in costs covered and local prices.
Before submitting an ESRC-FAPESP Lead Agency Agreement proposal, all applicants should consult the Je-S guidance (PDF, 191Kb).
Applicants are also strongly advised to consult the Operation of the
UKRI-FAPESP Lead Agency Agreement Guidance Note (UKRI website)

Proposal Form and Attachments

The title field of the proposal must begin with the words 'ESRC-FAPESP'. 
The 5,000 word proposal document described in the International Common Application Process (ICAP) criteria should be included as the 'Case for Support' in the Je-S application. This 5,000 word limit exceeds the normal six page limit for a Case for Support. A word count should be included at the end of this document. This is the only part of the ICAP process which is followed.
To enable the identification of research team members in different national application formats, the 5,000 word research proposal document should begin by listing the names, roles (principal investigator, co-investigator, etc), and institutions of all named researchers from both participating countries who are included in the proposal. This list of names is not included in the word count of the proposal.
CVs of all named researchers in the proposal should be included, both UK and overseas. These should not exceed the normal ESRC limit of two pages per CV.
For State of São Paulo-based researchers, the FAPESP letter of eligibility should be submitted to FAPESP (SAGe) and also provided to the UK PI to upload to Je-S as part of their application. State of São Paulo-based researchers should also complete the FAPESP Proposal Form (which includes the FAPESP consolidated budget) and submit this via SAGe. The FAPESP full proposal form should then be saved as a PDF and attached to the UK PI’s Je-S submission. This should be exactly the same version as submitted via SAGe.
All other relevant sections of the Je-S application (Objectives, Summary, Beneficiaries, etc) should be completed in accordance with the normal guidelines for standard research grants unless specified in the Je-S guidance (PDF, 191Kb).

ESRC intends to fund new research projects as part of the UK Research and Innovation response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Proposals are invited for short to medium-term economic and social research activity aimed at addressing and mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Proposals can be received under this call at any time and will be assessed on a rolling basis.  The call now includes a highlight notice focussed on COVID-19 and minority ethnic groups.  Full details on how to apply can be found at:
https://www.ukri.org/funding/funding-opportunities/ukri-open-call-for-research-and-innovation-ideas-to-address-covid-19/
Proposals will be accepted from anyone who is normally eligible to apply for ESRC funding. Proposals that are primarily social science will need to comply with ESRC funding guidelines, except where the call details at the link above state an exception to these. Awards will be subject to the standard terms and conditions for ESRC funding, please see our Research Funding Guide for further information.
Proposals must be novel and not duplicative of existing research activity. See social science projects that have already been funded through the call.
The role of the economic and social sciences
The impact of COVID-19 is vast and varied, complex and evolving. From major disruptions to the global economy through to the dislocation of normal personal relationships, no country, business, community, family or individual has escaped its impacts. In addition to the direct health impacts of the virus, the economic, social, demographic, environmental, psychological, behavioural, political and institutional responses to, and consequences of, the pandemic have been, and will continue to be, profound. The social sciences, individually or working with other disciplines, have a key role to play in understanding, addressing and mitigating the unfolding impacts of the pandemic.
The need for new research
ESRC is looking to fund new research projects and related data collection of up to 18 months duration which will extend the evidence base and make a significant contribution to the understanding of, and response to, COVID-19 and its impacts. These projects will address fundamental gaps in our knowledge and provide practical evidence that could be of use in considering ways of responding to or mitigating the pandemic and its impacts, with a strong emphasis on producing findings that can be used during the research as well as on its completion.
The focus of this call is set very much in the context of the national response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We do however see value in international comparative research which provides understanding of different responses to and ways of mitigating the impacts of the pandemic. However, the research must be directly relevant to the UK.
We welcome applications on any topics which can provide new and policy-relevant insights into the impacts of the pandemic. Proposals should explain the level of urgency and demonstrate a clear route to impact within the timescale of the project. Longer term projects that don't meet the urgency guidelines should be submitted through normal responsive mode.
Applicants whose proposals have a strong public health or social care focus should consider applying to NIHR where appropriate. Research focused on practical applications and patient benefit, intervention evaluation, health management and health service configuration, and the specific needs of the health and social care sector and workforce usually fall into the remit of the NIHR.
Please ensure you are fully familiar with the details of the UKRI call, as set out here, before applying.
ESRC have commissioned and published a review of research to address the question: What is known about the impacts of social isolation on disadvantaged, marginalised, and vulnerable populations in the context of pandemics and other public health crises? This review identifies gaps in research.  For more information, please see: Impacts of social isolation among disadvantaged and vulnerable groups during public health crises. 
Application outcomes
Our aim is to ensure that, applicants receive feedback on their applications within ten working days of submission however due to unprecedented volumes it may take up to 20 days.
Requests to switch existing ESRC award funding to address Covid-19 research priorities
UKRI has put in place a process to allow researchers to propose repurposing existing ESRC award funding to address COVID-19 research priorities. For further details go to

Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs) are one of the biggest schemes we fund as part of our commitment to knowledge exchange. The KTP scheme's mission is to strengthen the UK's competitiveness and wealth creation by enabling research organisations to apply their research knowledge to important business problems.
Background and aims
At the heart of each KTP is a relationship between a company/organisation and staff in a knowledge base institution. The institution's staff apply their expertise to a project that will help the development of their collaborative partner. The project is carried out by an associate (a recent graduate or postgraduate), who also benefits from an organised training programme. In the process, the business relevance of the knowledge base institution is enhanced.
Innovate UK have produced a brochure that describes how KTPs can help to innovate and grow your business:

Need some help to innovate and grow your business? (PDF, 1.1Mb)

KTP funding
The KTP scheme is supported by a number of sponsors, the largest of which is Innovate UK, who are responsible for managing the scheme. Other Research Councils are also involved as are the Welsh Government and The Scottish Government. Participating businesses and organisational partners also contribute to each project.
ESRC funding criteria
We will support highly innovative KTP projects to exchange knowledge, skills and/or technology arising from excellent social science. Priority will be given to KTPs with businesses and with civil society organisations, and with public sector organisations where there is a clear demonstration of social science being used in a new way.
You can see the overarching funding criteria for KTPs and the research council criteria on the KTP website:

KTP funding criteria (KTP website)

Dissemination of impacts and outcomes
We actively encourage KTPs to engage with other stakeholders to disseminate results, impacts and outcomes.
KTP blogs
The following blogs are by KTP assosciates receiving ESRC funding.

The Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate (SBE) of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) are pleased to announce their continued support of international collaboration under the SBE-UKRI Lead Agency Opportunity. The goal of this activity is to promote transatlantic collaborative research by reducing some of the barriers to conducting international research that researchers may encounter. The SBE-UKRI Lead Agency Opportunity allows US and UK researchers to submit a single collaborative proposal that will undergo a single review process.
Remit
Proposals will be accepted for collaborative research in areas at the intersection of NSF/SBE and UKRI’s remits. The primary UK Research Councils participating in this activity are the ESRC, the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).

Proposers should review the programmes supported through NSF/SBE and through the relevant UK Research Council(s) for further information on what areas of research are eligible for support through this activity. Please see the “Specific guidelines” below for more information.

Collaborative research proposals may be submitted in any disciplinary or interdisciplinary area which falls within the remit of the AHRC, BBSRC and/or ESRC, and NSF/SBE. Please see the SBE website for more details on which SBE programs are eligible.
Budget
Proposals are expected to adhere to the proposal sizes and durations for the relevant UK Research Council(s) and SBE programme(s) from which funding is sought. Please see the “Specific guidelines” or the Je-S Guidance below for more information on funding levels available.
How to apply
There is a two-stage application process. Stage 1 (Expression of Interest) must be completed prior to Stage 2 (Full Proposal). Please allow ample time (at least three to four weeks) prior to your intended proposal submission target date. Please see the Guidelines below for full details of the submission process and use the Expression of Interest (EOI) template provided below.

This Lead Agency Opportunity is two-way and as such proposals may be submitted to either NSF/SBE (via FastLane) or one of the three participating Research Councils (via Je-S, depending on the remit of the proposed research).

The lead agency should be decided on the basis of where the largest proportion of research lies (financially). Where the ESRC is the lead agency, applicants are required to submit proposals via Je-S in accordance with the requirements outlined in the ESRC Research Funding Guide and according to the Je-S guidance found below.
