Data was collected from the NIH (https://www.nih.gov/) annd UKRI (https://www.ukri.org) and filtered based on keywords representing open research practices (e.g. open access). Databases where information could not be automatically collected but which nevertheless present relevant information on grants related to open research should be consulted.
